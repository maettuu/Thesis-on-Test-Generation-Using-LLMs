Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of keyboard shortcuts in the tools.js file. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the KeyboardManager class is being updated to include "mac+Delete" as a shortcut for the delete function. This means that on macOS, pressing Delete should trigger the delete action.

So, the test needs to verify that before the patch, pressing Delete on macOS didn't delete the selected element, and after the patch, it does. 

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create a test case that simulates pressing the Delete key on macOS and checks if the selected editor is removed.

I'll import the necessary modules, like AnnotationEditorUIManager and KeyboardManager. Then, I'll set up a mock environment, including a mock event bus and PDF document. 

I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditorUIManager and add a mock editor. I'll simulate selecting this editor and then trigger a keydown event with the Delete key, using the metaKey to simulate the macOS command key.

Before the patch, this event shouldn't trigger the delete action, so the editor should still be present. After the patch, the same event should remove the editor.

In the test, I'll check if the editor is deleted after the event is dispatched. If it is, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll use dynamic imports for compatibility with Node.js.

So, the test will look like this: it checks if the delete function is called when the Delete key is pressed on macOS, ensuring the selected editor is removed.

```javascript
it("should delete selected element when pressing Delete key on macOS", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, KeyboardManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  
  const eventBus = {
    _on: jest.fn(),
    _off: jest.fn(),
    dispatch: jest.fn(),
  };
  
  const pdfDocument = new PDFDocument({
    numPages: 1,
    firstPage: () => ({}),
  });
  
  const pageColors = {};
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  
  const manager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(container, eventBus, pdfDocument, pageColors);
  const editor = {
    id: "test-editor",
    select: jest.fn(),
    unselect: jest.fn(),
    remove: jest.fn(),
    commitOrRemove: jest.fn(),
    isEmpty: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(false),
  };
  
  manager.addEditor(editor);
  manager.setSelected(editor);
  
  const event = {
    key: "Delete",
    metaKey: true,
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
    stopPropagation: jest.fn(),
  };
  
  manager.keydown(event);
  
  expect(editor.remove).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

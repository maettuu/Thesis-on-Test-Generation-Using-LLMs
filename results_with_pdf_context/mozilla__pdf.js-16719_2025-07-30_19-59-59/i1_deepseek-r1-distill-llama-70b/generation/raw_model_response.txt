Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of keyboard shortcuts, so the test should ensure that after the patch, using Delete on Mac deletes the annotation.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It has imports from various modules, including annotation.js, util.js, and test_utils.js. I can use these imports in my test.

I'll create a test case using Jest's it function. The test should simulate selecting an annotation and pressing Delete on Mac to see if it gets deleted.

I'll start by setting up the necessary mocks. I'll create a mock PDF document with an annotationStorage that has an annotation. I'll also mock the event bus to listen for the 'delete' event.

Next, I'll initialize the AnnotationEditorUIManager with the container, eventBus, pdfDocument, and pageColors. Then, I'll create an AnnotationEditorLayer and set it as the active layer.

I'll create a sample annotation, add it to the annotationStorage, and select it. Then, I'll simulate a keydown event with the Delete key and the meta key (for Mac). 

I'll check if the 'delete' event is triggered and if the annotation is removed from the storage. If both conditions are met, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test so that it initializes all variables within the function and doesn't rely on external state.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring that it correctly mocks the necessary components and accurately simulates the user's action to test the Delete functionality on Mac.

```javascript
it("should delete selected annotation when pressing Delete on Mac", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, AnnotationEditorLayer } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { Annotation, MarkupAnnotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  
  // Mock the necessary objects
  const pdfDocument = {
    annotationStorage: {
      getAnnotations: () => [],
      addAnnotation: jest.fn(),
      removeAnnotation: jest.fn(),
    },
    filterFactory: {},
  };
  
  const eventBus = {
    _on: jest.fn(),
    _off: jest.fn(),
  };
  
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const pageColors = {};
  
  // Initialize the AnnotationEditorUIManager
  const annotationEditorUIManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(
    container,
    eventBus,
    pdfDocument,
    pageColors
  );
  
  // Create an AnnotationEditorLayer
  const annotationEditorLayer = new AnnotationEditorLayer();
  annotationEditorUIManager.#activeEditor = annotationEditorLayer;
  
  // Create a test annotation
  const annotation = new MarkupAnnotation({
    id: "test-annotation",
    type: "highlight",
    color: "#ff0000",
    page: 1,
  });
  
  // Add the annotation to storage
  pdfDocument.annotationStorage.addAnnotation(annotation);
  
  // Select the annotation
  annotationEditorLayer.selectAnnotation(annotation.id);
  
  // Simulate Mac Delete key press
  const deleteEvent = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
    key: "Delete",
    keyCode: 46,
    metaKey: true,
  });
  
  // Trigger the keydown handler
  annotationEditorUIManager.keydown(deleteEvent);
  
  // Verify the annotation was removed
  expect(pdfDocument.annotationStorage.removeAnnotation).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

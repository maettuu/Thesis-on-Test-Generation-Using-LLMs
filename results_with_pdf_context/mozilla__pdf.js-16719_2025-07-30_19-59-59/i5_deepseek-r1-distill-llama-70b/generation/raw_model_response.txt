Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of shortcuts in the AnnotationEditorUIManager. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch is adding support for the Delete key on macOS. So before the patch, pressing Delete on macOS didn't trigger the delete action, but after the patch, it should.

My test needs to verify this behavior. I'll use a test PDF file, probably a simple one with annotations. I'll create an annotation, select it, and simulate pressing the Delete key.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument, Annotation, and AnnotationEditorUIManager. Then, I'll load the test PDF, create an annotation, add it to the page, and set up the UI manager.

Next, I'll simulate the keydown event with the Delete key. On macOS, the key is 'Delete', but the event's key property might be 'Delete' or 'Del' depending on the browser. I'll set the isComposing property to false to simulate a real key press.

After triggering the event, I'll check if the annotation was removed from the page. If the test passes after the patch, the annotation should be gone, meaning the delete action worked.

I need to make sure all dependencies are correctly imported using dynamic imports to avoid issues with Node.js. I'll also ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files except for the test PDF.

Finally, I'll write the test as an async function using it() and include the necessary setup and assertions. This should cover the scenario where the Delete key on macOS now correctly deletes the selected annotation after the patch.

```javascript
it("should delete selected annotation when Delete key is pressed on macOS", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");

  // Load test PDF
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(await fetch("test.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer()));

  // Create annotation
  const annotation = new Annotation({
    type: Annotation.Type.MARKUP,
    subtype: Annotation.Type.UNDERLINE,
    quads: [[10, 10, 20, 10, 20, 20, 10, 20]],
    page: 0
  });

  // Add annotation to first page
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  page.addAnnotation(annotation);

  // Set up UI manager
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager({
    document: pdf,
    page: page,
    annotation: annotation,
    container: document.createElement('div')
  });

  // Simulate Delete key press on macOS
  const event = new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {
    key: 'Delete',
    keyCode: 8, // Mac Delete key code
    isComposing: false
  });

  // Trigger the keydown event
  uiManager.container.dispatchEvent(event);

  // Verify annotation was removed
  expect(page.getAnnotations().length).toBe(0);
});
```

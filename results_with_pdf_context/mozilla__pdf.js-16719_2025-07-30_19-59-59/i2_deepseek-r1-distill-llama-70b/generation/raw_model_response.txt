Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of key bindings for the delete action. 

First, I should understand the problem. Before the patch, on macOS, using the Delete key (which might be fn+Backspace) didn't trigger the delete action. The patch includes "mac+Delete" in the key bindings, so now it should work.

The test needs to simulate pressing Delete on macOS and check if the selected annotation gets deleted. 

I'll use the test utilities provided. I'll create a PDF document with an annotation, select it, and simulate the keydown event with the Delete key. Then, I'll verify that the annotation was removed.

I'll import the necessary modules: PDFDocument, Annotation, and the test utils. Then, I'll create a sample PDF page with an annotation. 

In the test, I'll set up the annotation editor, select the annotation, and dispatch a keydown event with the code 'Delete' and meta key (since it's macOS). 

After triggering the event, I'll check if the annotation is no longer in the storage. 

This should fail before the patch because the key binding wasn't present, and pass after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should delete selected annotation when Delete key is pressed on macOS", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  // Create a PDF document with one page containing an annotation
  const pdfDoc = await PDFDocument.load(
    buildGetDocumentParams("test.pdf", new Uint8Array())
  );
  const page = (await pdfDoc.getPage(1));
  const annotation = new Annotation();
  page.addAnnotation(annotation);

  // Set up the annotation editor
  const editorManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(
    document.createElement("div"),
    {
      _on: () => {},
      _off: () => {},
      _dispatch: () => {},
    },
    pdfDoc,
    new Map()
  );

  // Select the annotation
  editorManager.selectAnnotation(annotation);

  // Simulate pressing Delete key on macOS (meta + Delete)
  const event = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
    key: "Delete",
    code: "Delete",
    metaKey: true,
  });

  // Dispatch the event
  editorManager.element.dispatchEvent(event);

  // Verify that the annotation was deleted
  expect(page.getAnnotations().length).toBe(0);
});
```

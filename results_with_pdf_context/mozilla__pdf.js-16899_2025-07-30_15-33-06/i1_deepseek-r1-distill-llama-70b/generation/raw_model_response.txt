Okay, I need to figure out how to write a regression test for the issue where the FreeText annotation isn't displayed. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a patch that modifies several files, particularly `annotation_layer.js`. The main changes are in the `AnnotationElement` class and its subclasses. They introduced a new method `_hasPopupData` and modified the constructors to set `isRenderable` to `true` instead of calculating it based on popupRef and other properties.

So, the issue is that before the patch, FreeText annotations without a `popupRef` weren't being rendered because `isRenderable` was set to `false`. The patch changes `isRenderable` to `true`, ensuring these annotations are rendered.

To write a test, I need to verify that after the patch, FreeText annotations without a popup are displayed correctly. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

Looking at the existing test file, I can use `getDocument` and `buildGetDocumentParams` to load the PDF. I'll need to load the specific PDF file `bug1851498.pdf` which has the problematic FreeText annotation.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Load the PDF document.
2. Get the first page.
3. Render the page to get the annotations.
4. Check if the FreeText annotation exists and is rendered.

I'll use `PDFPageProxy` to get the page and then access the annotations. I'll loop through them to find the FreeText one. If it exists and is rendered, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll import necessary modules dynamically. Also, since this is a unit test, I'll structure it within an `it` block using async/await for proper asynchronous handling.

Potential issues to consider:
- The PDF might have multiple annotations, so I need to correctly identify the FreeText one.
- Ensure that the test correctly handles cases where the annotation might not be present.
- Use `await` properly to handle asynchronous operations like loading the document and page.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the test code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should display freetext annotation when popup data is present", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1851498.pdf'));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const pageProxy = new (await import('../../src/display/api.js').then(m => m.PDFPageProxy))(page);
  const annotations = await pageProxy.getAnnotations();
  
  const freeTextAnnotation = annotations.find(annotation => 
    annotation instanceof (await import('../../src/display/annotation_layer.js').then(m => m.FreeTextAnnotationElement))
  );
  
  expect(freeTextAnnotation).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should not attempt to fetch WASM or ICC files when wasmUrl or iccUrl are missing", async () => {
  const { ColorSpaceUtils } = await import("../../src/core/colorspace_utils.js");
  const { CmykICCBasedCS } = await import("../../src/core/icc_colorspace.js");
  const { DeviceCmykCS } = await import("../../src/core/colorspace.js");
  const xhrCalls = [];
  const OriginalXHR = global.XMLHttpRequest;
  function FakeXHR() {}
  FakeXHR.prototype.open = function(method, url) {
    xhrCalls.push(url);
  };
  FakeXHR.prototype.send = function() {};
  global.XMLHttpRequest = FakeXHR;
  const cs = ColorSpaceUtils.cmyk;
  global.XMLHttpRequest = OriginalXHR;
  if (cs instanceof CmykICCBasedCS) {
    throw new Error("Expected fallback to DeviceCmykCS due to missing iccUrl");
  }

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/pdf_spec.js` file before running it.

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pasting an image from the clipboard into the editor doesn't work. The patch provided adds support for this feature, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing code. The test file is editor_spec.js, and it imports CommandManager from tools.js. I can use that as a starting point.

I need to simulate the clipboard paste event. I'll create a mock ClipboardEvent with a DataTransfer object containing an image file. I'll use a small PNG as the image source for testing.

Next, I'll set up the UI manager. Since this is a unit test, I'll mock the necessary dependencies. I'll create a mock AnnotationEditorUIManager and stub out methods like registerEditorTypes, addLayer, and deserialize.

The key part is handling the paste event. I'll call the paste method on the UI manager with the mock event. Before the patch, this should not create any new editors because the functionality wasn't implemented. After the patch, it should create a StampEditor.

I'll structure the test to check if any editors were added after the paste event. If the length of editors is greater than zero, it means the paste was successful.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses only the provided imports. I'll dynamically import any necessary modules within the test block.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest syntax, ensuring it's concise and directly tests the paste functionality.

```javascript
it("should create a new editor when pasting an image from clipboard", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/stamp.js");

  // Mock clipboard event with image data
  const mockClipboardEvent = {
    preventDefault: () => {},
    clipboardData: {
      items: [
        {
          type: "image/png",
          getAsFile: () => new File([/* png data */ "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "image/png")
        }
      ]
    }
  };

  // Mock UI manager
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(
    {} as any,
    {} as any,
    {} as any,
    {} as any,
    {} as any
  );

  // Mock editor layer
  const mockLayer = {
    deserialize: () => new StampEditor({}),
    add: () => {}
  };

  // Register editor types
  uiManager.registerEditorTypes([StampEditor]);

  // Add mock layer
  uiManager.addLayer(mockLayer);

  // Call paste method
  uiManager.paste(mockClipboardEvent);

  // Verify that a new editor was created
  expect(uiManager.#allEditors.size).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

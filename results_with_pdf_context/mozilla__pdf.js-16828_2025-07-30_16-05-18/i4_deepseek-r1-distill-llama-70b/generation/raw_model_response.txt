Okay, I need to write a test that checks if pasting an image from the clipboard works correctly in editing mode. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after. 

First, I'll start by understanding the issue. The problem is that when in editing mode, the application doesn't support pasting an image from the clipboard. The patch provided adds functionality to handle this by checking the MIME type of the clipboard content and creating the appropriate editor, in this case, a StampEditor.

So, the test needs to simulate the user copying an image to the clipboard and then pasting it into the editor. I'll need to mock the clipboard events and data to simulate this scenario.

I'll use Jest for testing, but since the code is in JavaScript, I'll structure the test using the `it` function. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically to avoid dependency issues.

I'll set up a mock DOM environment because the code interacts with the DOM for clipboard events and document elements. Using `jsdom` will help create a virtual DOM for testing.

Next, I'll mock the clipboard data. I'll create a mock `DataTransfer` object with an item that has the correct MIME type for an image, like 'image/png'. I'll include a mock file and data URL to simulate the image data.

I'll then create an instance of `AnnotationEditorUIManager` and `AnnotationEditorLayer` to handle the UI logic. The layer will be set up with a div element to simulate the editor area.

I'll simulate the paste event by dispatching it to the document body. This should trigger the paste handler in the UI manager, which should create a new StampEditor if the clipboard data is handled correctly.

After triggering the paste event, I'll check if a new editor was added to the layer. If the test passes, it means the patch correctly handled the image paste.

I'll structure the test to import the necessary modules, set up the mocks, simulate the events, and assert the expected outcome. The test should be self-contained and not rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided.

I also need to ensure that the test is concise and only tests the specific functionality without unnecessary complexity. This way, it's clear whether the patch resolves the issue when the test passes.

```javascript
it("should paste an image from clipboard in editing mode", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorLayer } = await import("../../src/display/editor/annotation_editor_layer.js");
  const { JSDOM } = await import("jsdom");

  // Setup mock DOM
  const dom = new JSDOM();
  globalThis.document = dom.window.document;
  globalThis.window = dom.window;

  // Mock clipboard data
  const mockClipboardData = {
    items: [{ kind: "file", type: "image/png", getAsFile: () => new File([""], "mock.png") }],
    getData: () => "mock-image-data"
  };

  // Mock paste event
  const mockEvent = {
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
    clipboardData: mockClipboardData
  };

  // Create UI manager and layer
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(null, null, null, null, null);
  const layer = new AnnotationEditorLayer({
    uiManager: uiManager,
    div: document.createElement("div"),
    pageIndex: 0,
    l10n: {},
    accessibilityManager: null,
    annotationLayer: null,
    viewport: null
  });

  // Set up editing mode
  uiManager.updateMode(AnnotationEditorType.STAMP);

  // Dispatch paste event
  document.body.dispatchEvent(new dom.window.CustomEvent("paste", { detail: mockEvent }));

  // Check if editor was added
  expect(layer.isEmpty).toBe(false);
});

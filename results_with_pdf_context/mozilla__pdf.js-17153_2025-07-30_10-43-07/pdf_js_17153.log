Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should handle missing navigatorplatform gracefully", async () => {
  const { FeatureTest } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const originalNavigator = global.navigator;
  global.navigator = { userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0" }; // Mock navigator without platform
  const expected = { isMac: false };
  const actual = FeatureTest.platform;
  global.navigator = originalNavigator; // Restore original navigator
  expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/util_spec.js` file before running it.

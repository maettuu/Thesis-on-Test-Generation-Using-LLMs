Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the mouse cursor changes correctly when resizing an image or drawing in a PDF. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll set up a test environment. I'll create a PDF document with a page and a sample image. Then, I'll simulate adding an image editor to the page.

I'll need to simulate the resizing action. Using pointer events, I'll trigger a pointerdown on the resizer, move the mouse, and then release. This should change the cursor shape during resizing.

After applying the patch, when I resize from the topLeft corner, the cursor should change to 'nwse-resize'. I'll check the cursor style of the resizer element after the pointermove event.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, create the PDF page, add an image, and then simulate the resizing. Finally, I'll assert that the cursor changes as expected.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, uses dynamic imports, and doesn't add any new dependencies. The test should clearly show that the patch fixes the issue by updating the cursor during resizing.

```javascript
it("should change cursor shape when resizing from different edges", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/pdf_document.js");
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { InkEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/ink.js");
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/stamp.js");

  // Setup a simple PDF document with one page
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();

  // Create an image editor
  const editor = new StampEditor({
    parent: {
      add: () => {},
      pageIndices: [0],
      pageIndex: 0,
      viewport: {
        rotation: 0,
        rawDims: { pageWidth: 100, pageHeight: 100 }
      }
    },
    uiManager: {},
    id: "test",
    bitmapUrl: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="
  });

  // Initialize the editor and render it
  editor.render();

  // Simulate pointer events to test resizing
  const resizer = editor.div.querySelector(".resizers");
  const startEvent = new PointerEvent("pointerdown", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    pointerType: "mouse",
    buttons: 1
  });
  resizer.dispatchEvent(startEvent);

  // Move the mouse to trigger resize
  const moveEvent = new PointerEvent("pointermove", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    pointerType: "mouse",
    buttons: 1,
    clientX: 100,
    clientY: 100
  });
  resizer.dispatchEvent(moveEvent);

  // Check the cursor shape after resizing from topLeft corner
  const expectedCursor = "nwse-resize";
  const actualCursor = resizer.style.cursor;

  expect(actualCursor).toBe(expectedCursor);
});
```

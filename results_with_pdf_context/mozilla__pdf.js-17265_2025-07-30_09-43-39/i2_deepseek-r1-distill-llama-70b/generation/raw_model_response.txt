Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a console error occurs when loading a module script because the MIME type is incorrect. The patch sets the type of the Blob to "text/javascript", which should fix the problem.

First, I'll create a test that checks if the Blob created by createCDNWrapper has the correct MIME type. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll need to use dynamic imports. I'll import PDFWorker from the display/api.js file.

Next, I'll define the createCDNWrapper function within the test. This function is supposed to create a Blob with the correct type. I'll set up a URL for the worker, like using a CDN URL as in the issue.

Then, I'll create the Blob using createCDNWrapper and check its type. I'll extract the MIME type from the Blob and compare it to "text/javascript".

If the type is correct, the test passes. If not, it fails. This test will ensure that the Blob now has the right MIME type after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should set correct MIME type for worker script", async () => {
  const { PDFWorker } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const createCDNWrapper = (url) => {
    const wrapper = `await import("${url}");`;
    return URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([wrapper], { type: "text/javascript" }));
  };
  const workerUrl = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/4.0.189/pdf.worker.min.mjs";
  const blobUrl = createCDNWrapper(workerUrl);
  const blob = await fetch(blobUrl).then(response => response.blob);
  expect(blob.type).toBe("text/javascript");
});
```

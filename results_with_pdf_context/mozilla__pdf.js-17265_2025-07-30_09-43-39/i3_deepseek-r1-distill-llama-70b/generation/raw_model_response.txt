Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where a console error occurs when loading PDF.js in the browser. The error is about the server responding with an empty MIME type when trying to load a module script. The patch provided adds the MIME type to the Blob when creating the worker script URL.

First, I'll look at the problem. The error happens because the Blob doesn't specify a type, so the browser doesn't recognize it as a JavaScript module. The patch adds 'text/javascript' to the Blob, which should fix this.

Now, I need to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check if the worker script is loaded correctly without errors.

I'll use the existing test file as a starting point. I'll import the necessary modules, like PDFWorker and the test utilities. I'll set up a fake worker to simulate the environment.

In the test, I'll create a PDFWorker instance and check if it initializes without errors. If the MIME type isn't set, the worker should fail to load, causing the test to fail. After the patch, the worker should load correctly.

I'll structure the test using async/await to handle the promises. I'll use Jest's expect to check if any errors occur during worker initialization.

So, the test will attempt to create a worker and expect it to resolve without errors. Before the patch, this should fail, and after, it should pass.

```javascript
it("should load worker scripts with correct MIME type", async () => {
  const { PDFWorker } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const workerParams = {
    name: "test-worker",
  };

  // Create a fake worker that will fail without the MIME type patch
  let error;
  const worker = await PDFWorker.fromPort({ port: {} }).catch(e => {
    error = e;
    return null;
  });

  // Since the worker should have failed to initialize due to MIME type issue
  await expect(error).rejects.toThrow(
    "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script"
  );
});
```

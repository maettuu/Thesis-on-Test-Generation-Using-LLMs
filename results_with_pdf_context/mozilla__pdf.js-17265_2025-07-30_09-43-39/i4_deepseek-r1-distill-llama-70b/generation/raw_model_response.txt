Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the fix for the issue where a console error occurs when loading a PDF using `pdf.worker.mjs` as a module script. The error is about the server responding with an empty MIME type, which suggests that the Blob used to create the worker isn't specifying the correct type.

Looking at the patch provided, the change is in the `createCDNWrapper` function within `PDFWorkerUtil`. Before the patch, the Blob was created without specifying the MIME type, which defaults to an empty string. The patch adds the `type` parameter as `"text/javascript"` when creating the Blob.

So, the test needs to check if the Blob created by `PDFWorkerUtil.createCDNWrapper` has the correct MIME type.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required files. I'll need `pdf.worker.mjs` and the `api.js` where `PDFWorkerUtil` is defined.

I'll set up a URL for the worker script. Then, I'll call `PDFWorkerUtil.createCDNWrapper` with this URL. This function should create a Blob with the correct type.

Next, I'll create a Blob using the `fetch` API to get the actual Blob from the worker URL. Then, I'll check the type of this Blob. It should be `text/javascript`.

I'll write an async test using `it` from a testing framework. The test will fetch the worker URL, create the Blob, and assert that its type matches the expected MIME type.

I need to make sure that the test only uses the provided imports and doesn't add any new dependencies. Also, the test should be self-contained and to the point, without any unnecessary comments or explanations.

Finally, I'll structure the test to fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring that the Blob's MIME type is correctly set to `"text/javascript"`.

```javascript
it("should set correct MIME type for worker scripts", async () => {
  const { PDFWorkerUtil } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const workerUrl = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/4.0.189/pdf.worker.min.mjs";
  
  const blob = PDFWorkerUtil.createCDNWrapper(workerUrl);
  const result = await fetch(blob).then(response => response.blob());
  
  expect(result.type).toBe("text/javascript");
});
```

Okay, so I need to write a test that verifies the patch resolves the issue where the black pin covers the image. The user provided a PDF file, issue16800.pdf, and a patch that modifies some code in annotation.js and annotation_layer.js. The goal is to ensure that after applying the patch, the pin no longer obstructs the image.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user mentioned that when opening a PDF and going to page 2, a black pin (annotation) covers an image. The expected behavior is that the image underneath should be visible without the pin. The patch seems to adjust how the fillAlpha property is handled, making the pin semi-transparent or hidden under certain conditions.

I need to create a test that checks if the pin is rendered correctly after the patch. The test should open the PDF, navigate to page 2, and check the visibility of the pin.

I'll use the provided test setup. I'll import the necessary modules, load the PDF, and get the page. Then, I'll render the page and check for annotations.

In the test, I'll look for the specific annotation (probably a FileAttachmentAnnotation) on page 2. I'll check if the annotation's fillAlpha is set to 0, which would make it invisible. If it's correctly set, the pin shouldn't cover the image.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll load the PDF, get the first page (since the issue is on page 2, but in zero-based index, it's page 1), and then check the annotations. I'll look for the annotation that's a FileAttachmentAnnotation and verify its fillAlpha is 0.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using the provided imports and the test_utils.js for building the document parameters. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the issue is resolved.

```javascript
it("should remove black pin annotation covering image", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue16800.pdf'));
  const { pdfDocument } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations({});
  
  const annotation = annotations.find(a => a.data.subtype === 'FileAttachment');
  
  expect(annotation.data.fillAlpha).toBe(0);
});
```

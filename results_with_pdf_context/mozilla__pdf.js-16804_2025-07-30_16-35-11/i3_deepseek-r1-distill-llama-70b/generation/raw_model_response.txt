Okay, I need to create a test for the patch that was provided. The issue is about removing embedded images, specifically a pin, so that the image underneath is visible. 

First, I should understand the problem. The user wants to remove the black pin from an annotation so the underlying image shows. The patch modifies the FileAttachmentAnnotation class to handle the fillAlpha and other properties.

I'll write a test that checks if the fillAlpha is correctly set, making the pin semi-transparent. 

I'll use the provided test file as a starting point. I'll import necessary modules and set up the PDF document. Then, I'll create an annotation with the patch applied and check if the fillAlpha is set correctly.

I'll define expected values, like fillAlpha being 0.5. Then, I'll create the annotation using the patched code and retrieve the actual fillAlpha value. Finally, I'll assert that the actual matches the expected.

This test will ensure the patch works as intended, allowing the image underneath to be visible through the pin.

```javascript
it("should remove embedded images correctly by setting fillAlpha", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams, createIdFactory } = await import('./test_utils.js');

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue16800.pdf'));
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();

  const expectedFillAlpha = 0.5;

  const annotationRef = new Ref(1);
  const dict = new Dict({
    Type: 'Annot',
    Subtype: 'FileAttachment',
    T: 'Test Annotation',
    Contents: 'Test Content',
    Rect: [0, 0, 100, 100],
    FS: 'EmbeddedFile',
    Name: 'PushPin'
  });

  const annotation = new FileAttachmentAnnotation({
    dict,
    xref: new XRefMock(idFactory),
    pdfManager: null,
    idFactory,
    collectFields: false
  });

  const actualFillAlpha = annotation.data.fillAlpha;

  expect(actualFillAlpha).toBe(expectedFillAlpha);
});
```

Okay, I need to create a test to verify that the password field is now correctly rendered as a password field with obscured input. 

First, I should get the PDF document using the provided code. I'll import getDocument from the correct path.

Then, I'll open the specific page where the password field is located. Once the PDF is loaded, I'll get the first page.

Next, I'll create a new PDFViewerPage and render the page to get the annotations.

Once the annotations are loaded, I'll look for the password field. I can identify it by its type being "Widget" and having the fieldFlags including PASSWORD.

After identifying the password field, I'll get its value. Before the patch, the field would be rendered as a normal text input, showing the actual text. After the patch, it should be a password input, hiding the characters.

I'll use the test to compare the initial value and the displayed value. If they match, it means the field is rendered correctly as a password.

I'll structure the test to import necessary modules, load the PDF, retrieve the password field, and assert the values match.

I should also ensure the test is concise and only tests this specific behavior, making it clear whether the patch works.

```javascript
it("should render password fields with obscured text", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19389.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDoc = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(0);
  
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations({ intent: "display" });
  
  const passwordAnnotation = annotations.find(annotation => annotation instanceof TextWidgetAnnotation && annotation.data.fieldFlags & AnnotationFieldFlag.PASSWORD);
  
  const expectedValue = "testpassword";
  const displayedValue = passwordAnnotation.data.fieldValue;
  
  expect(displayedValue).toBe(expectedValue);
});
```

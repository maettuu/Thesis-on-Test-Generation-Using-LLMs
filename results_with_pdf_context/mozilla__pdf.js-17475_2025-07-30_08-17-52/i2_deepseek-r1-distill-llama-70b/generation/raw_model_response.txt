Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the highlight isn't visible when saving or printing a cropped PDF. The patch provided modifies the serializeBoxes and serializeOutlines methods to include the rect parameter, which I assume is related to the crop box.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the methods now take a rect parameter which is the crop box. Before, the calculations didn't account for the crop, so the highlights were misplaced when printed.

To test this, I'll create a test that checks if the quadPoints and outlines are correctly calculated with the crop box. I'll load the provided PDF, create a highlight, serialize it, and compare the expected and actual quadPoints.

I'll need to import the necessary modules: getDocument from display/api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, load the PDF and get the first page.

Next, I'll set up the highlight editor with some boxes. Then, I'll call serialize() to get the data. I'll extract the quadPoints and outlines and check if they match the expected values considering the crop.

I'll define the expected quadPoints based on the crop box. Since I don't have the exact values, I'll leave placeholders and update them after running the test once, as per the example.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest's it function, making sure it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the issue is resolved.

```javascript
it("should correctly serialize highlight annotations within the crop box", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1872721.pdf'));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorType } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    annotationType: AnnotationEditorType.HIGHLIGHT,
    color: "#fff066",
    opacity: 1,
    pageIndex: 0,
    page,
  });

  editor.#boxes = [{ x: 0.1, y: 0.1, width: 0.2, height: 0.2 }];
  editor.width = 0.3;
  editor.height = 0.3;
  editor.x = 0.1;
  editor.y = 0.1;

  const data = editor.serialize();
  const expectedQuadPoints = [100, 100, 200, 200, 300, 300, 400, 400]; // Replace with actual expected values
  const expectedOutlines = [[100, 100, 200, 200]]; // Replace with actual expected values

  expect(data.quadPoints).toEqual(expectedQuadPoints);
  expect(data.outlines).toEqual(expectedOutlines);
});

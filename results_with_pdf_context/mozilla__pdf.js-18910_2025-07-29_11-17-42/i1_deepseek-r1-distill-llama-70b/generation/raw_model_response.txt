Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that uses ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main changes are in jpeg_stream.js and image.js. In jpeg_stream.js, a new method getTransferableImage was added to JpegStream. This method checks if ImageDecoder can be used and then tries to decode the image using it. 

So, the test should check if the ImageDecoder is being used correctly. I'll create a test that loads a JPEG image, checks if getTransferableImage returns a bitmap, and then verifies that the image is decoded correctly.

I'll use the provided test file as a base. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFImage, JpegStream, and JpegImage. Then, I'll set up a mock XRef using XRefMock. 

In the test, I'll create a sample JPEG data to simulate the image. Then, I'll create instances of JpegStream and PDFImage. I'll call getImageBytes on the PDFImage to trigger the decoding. 

After the patch, if ImageDecoder is supported, getTransferableImage should return a bitmap, and the image data should be correct. I'll check if the data exists and has the expected properties.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test to fail before the patch because without the patch, getTransferableImage would return null, and the image data might not be as expected.

So, the test will look something like this: create the necessary objects, call the methods, and assert that the data is correctly decoded using ImageDecoder.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for JPEG images", async () => {
  const { PDFImage } = await import("../../src/core/image.js");
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const { XRefMock } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const data = new Uint8Array([
    0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0, 0x00, 0x10, 0x4a, 0x46, 0x49, 0x46, 0x00, 0x01,
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xfe, 0x00, 0x1d, 0x54, 0x68,
    0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x61, 0x20, 0x74, 0x65, 0x73,
    0x74, 0x20, 0x4a, 0x50, 0x45, 0x47, 0x20, 0x69, 0x6d, 0x61, 0x67,
    0x65, 0x2e, 0xff, 0xd9
  ]);

  const stream = new JpegStream(new BaseStream(), data.length, {});
  const image = new PDFImage({
    xref,
    res: {},
    image: stream,
    isInline: true,
  });

  const result = await image.getImageBytes();
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
});

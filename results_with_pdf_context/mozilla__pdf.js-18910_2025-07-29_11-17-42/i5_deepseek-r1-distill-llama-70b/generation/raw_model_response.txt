Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that uses ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main modifications are in jpeg_stream.js and jpg.js. The JpegStream class now has a getTransferableImage method that uses ImageDecoder. The JpegImage class has a canUseImageDecoder method that checks if the image can be decoded with ImageDecoder.

The goal is to test whether the new ImageDecoder implementation correctly decodes a JPEG image. So, the test should create a JpegStream, attempt to get a transferable image, and check if it's not null.

I should create a sample JPEG data for testing. Maybe use a small JPEG buffer, like the one from a 1x1 red pixel image. That's simple and reliable.

In the test, I'll import the necessary modules: JpegStream from jpeg_stream.js and JpegImage from jpg.js. Then, I'll create a JpegStream instance with the sample data.

Before the patch, getTransferableImage didn't exist, so calling it would return null. After the patch, if everything works, it should return a valid image.

I'll structure the test with an async function. Inside, I'll set up the sample data, create the JpegStream, and call getTransferableImage. Then, I'll assert that the result is not null.

I should also handle any potential errors, maybe with a try-catch block, but since the test expects it to pass after the patch, I can assume it won't throw.

So, the test will look something like this: create the stream, call getTransferableImage, and check that the returned bitmap isn't null. This should fail before the patch because the method didn't exist or returned null, and pass after the patch because ImageDecoder is used.

I need to make sure all imports are correct and that the test is self-contained. Also, since this is a Node.js environment, I'll use dynamic imports as shown in the example.

Putting it all together, the test will import the required modules, set up the data, create the stream, and assert the result. This should validate that the patch correctly implements the ImageDecoder optimization.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for JPEG images", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");

  // Create a minimal JPEG buffer (1x1 red pixel)
  const jpegData = new Uint8Array([
    0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00, 0x10, 0x4A, 0x46, 0x49, 0x46, 0x00, 0x01,
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xDB, 0x00, 0xC0, 0x00, 0x04, 0x05, 0x04,

    0x00, 0xFF, 0xDA, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xD9
  ]);

  const stream = new JpegStream({
    stream: { getBytes: () => jpegData },
    params: { colorTransform: -1 }
  });

  const image = await stream.getTransferableImage();
  expect(image).not.toBeNull();
});

Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the regression fix for using ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the patch provided. It modifies several files, but the main changes are in jpeg_stream.js where getTransferableImage is added to JpegStream. This function checks if ImageDecoder is supported and uses it to get a bitmap, which should speed up image decoding.

I need to write a test that checks if ImageDecoder is used correctly. The test should create a JpegStream instance, call getTransferableImage, and verify that it returns a bitmap when possible.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required files. I'll create a mock XRef using XRefMock from test_utils.js to simulate the PDF data.

Next, I'll set up a sample JPEG data to pass to JpegStream. Then, I'll create an instance of JpegStream with this data and the mock XRef.

I'll call getTransferableImage on this stream. Before the patch, this function didn't exist or returned null. After the patch, it should return a bitmap if ImageDecoder is supported.

In the test, I'll check if the function exists and if it returns a valid bitmap. I'll use async/await since the function is asynchronous.

I'll structure the test with Jest, using it("should ...", async () => { ... }). I'll handle any potential errors and log them if the test fails.

Finally, I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and not adding any new dependencies.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for faster image decoding", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { XRefMock } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const jpegData = new Uint8Array([
    0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0, 0x00, 0x10, 0x4a, 0x46, 0x49, 0x46, 0x00,
    0x50, 0x00, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xe1, 0x00, 0x58,
    0x48, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0d, 0x41, 0x44, 0x53, 0x4f, 0x42, 0x45,
    0x41, 0x4d, 0x00, 0x53, 0x74, 0x72, 0x79, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xfe, 0x00, 0x58, 0x50, 0x49, 0x58, 0x4c, 0x45,
    0x59, 0x00, 0x53, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xd9
  ]);

  const stream = new JpegStream({
    stream: new StringStream(jpegData),
    maybeLength: jpegData.length,
    params: {}
  });

  const result = await stream.getTransferableImage();

  expect(typeof stream.getTransferableImage).toBe("function");
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
});

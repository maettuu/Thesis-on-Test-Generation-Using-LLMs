Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch fixes the bug where a TypeError occurs when using annotations on a PDF, especially on touch devices. The error is 'null is not an object' evaluating 'this.#touchMoveAC.abort'. 

First, I should understand the issue. The problem happens when the user draws and then stops, causing the touchMoveAC to be null. The patch adds a check in touch_manager.js to ensure #touchMoveAC is not null before calling abort. 

So, the test should simulate a scenario where this situation occurs. I'll use the test framework to set up a TouchManager instance, simulate touch events, and ensure that the error doesn't occur after the patch.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules: TouchManager from touch_manager.js and AnnotationEditorUIManager from tools.js. 

Next, I'll set up the test case. I'll create a container element to simulate touch events. Then, I'll instantiate the TouchManager with this container and mock functions for the onPinch events.

I'll simulate touch events: start with two touches, move them, and then end the touch. The key is to ensure that when the touch ends, the #touchMoveAC is aborted safely.

Before the patch, the test should fail because the code would try to call abort on a null #touchMoveAC. After the patch, the code should check if #touchMoveAC exists before calling abort, so the test should pass without errors.

I'll structure the test to create the TouchManager, simulate the touch events, and then check if any errors occur. If no errors are thrown, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses the correct import paths. Since I'm using Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports.

Putting it all together, the test will create the TouchManager, simulate the touch events, and expect no errors. This should validate that the patch resolves the issue.

```javascript
it("should handle touch events without throwing null abort error", async () => {
  const { TouchManager } = await import("../../src/display/touch_manager.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");

  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const onPinchStart = jest.fn();
  const onPinching = jest.fn();
  const onPinchEnd = jest.fn();

  const touchManager = new TouchManager({
    container,
    onPinchStart,
    onPinching,
    onPinchEnd,
    signal: new AbortController().signal,
  });

  // Simulate touch events
  const touchStartEvt = {
    touches: [{ screenX: 100, screenY: 100, identifier: 1 }],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };
  const touchMoveEvt = {
    touches: [
      { screenX: 150, screenY: 150, identifier: 1 },
      { screenX: 200, screenY: 200, identifier: 2 },
    ],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };
  const touchEndEvt = {
    touches: [],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };

  // Test touch events
  touchManager._onTouchStart(touchStartEvt);
  touchManager._onTouchMove(touchMoveEvt);
  touchManager._onTouchEnd(touchEndEvt);

  expect(() => {
    touchManager._onTouchEnd(touchEndEvt);
  }).not.toThrow();

  touchManager.destroy();
});
```

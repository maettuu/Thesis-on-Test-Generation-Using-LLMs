Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a TypeError occurs when using annotations on a PDF in Safari on iOS. The error is "null is not an object (evaluating 'this.#touchMoveAC.abort')" and it happens when drawing and moving around.

First, I should understand the problem. The error occurs because `this.#touchMoveAC` is null when `abort()` is called on it. Looking at the provided patch, in `touch_manager.js`, the code now checks if `this.#touchMoveAC` is not null before calling `abort()`. So the test needs to simulate the scenario where this would fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll use the existing test file `test/unit/pdf_spec.js` and add a new test case. The test should simulate touch events that would trigger the error.

I'll set up a `TouchManager` instance. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll mock the necessary browser APIs like `AbortController`, `document`, and `window`. I'll create a container element and simulate touch events.

The test will involve starting a touch interaction, moving, and then ending it. Before the patch, this would cause the error because `#touchMoveAC` might be null when `abort()` is called. After the patch, the check prevents this.

I'll structure the test to mock the necessary events and verify that no error is thrown. I'll use `jest.spyOn` to mock `console.error` and ensure it's not called with the expected error message.

So, the test will:

1. Import necessary modules and set up mocks for browser APIs.
2. Create a `TouchManager` instance with the mocked container and signals.
3. Simulate touch start, move, and end events.
4. Check that no error is thrown and that the `abort` method is called correctly.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import `TouchManager` from the correct path and set up all mocks within the test block.

Finally, the test will assert that the error doesn't occur by checking the console logs and that the `abort` method was called as expected.

```javascript
it("should not throw when touch move abort is called on null", async () => {
  const { TouchManager } = await import("../../src/display/touch_manager.js");
  const container = {
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
  };

  const signal = new AbortController().signal;
  const touchManager = new TouchManager({
    container,
    signal,
  });

  // Mock required browser APIs
  const mockAbortController = {
    abort: jest.fn(),
  };
  jest.spyOn(window, 'AbortController').mockImplementation(() => mockAbortController);

  // Mock touch events
  const touchStartEvt = {
    touches: [
      { screenX: 100, screenY: 100, identifier: 1 },
      { screenX: 200, screenY: 200, identifier: 2 },
    ],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };
  const touchMoveEvt = {
    touches: [
      { screenX: 150, screenY: 150, identifier: 1 },
      { screenX: 250, screenY: 250, identifier: 2 },
    ],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };
  const touchEndEvt = {
    touches: [],
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };

  // Mock console.error to check for errors
  const mockConsoleError = jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});

  // Simulate touch events
  touchManager['onTouchStart'](touchStartEvt);
  touchManager['onTouchMove'](touchMoveEvt);
  touchManager['onTouchEnd'](touchEndEvt);

  // Verify no error was thrown
  expect(mockConsoleError).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    "TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'this.#touchMoveAC.abort')"
  );

  // Verify abort was called on touchMoveAC if it exists
  if (touchManager['#touchMoveAC']) {
    expect(mockAbortController.abort).toHaveBeenCalled();
  }
});

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug described. The bug is a TypeError that occurs when using annotations on a PDF, particularly on an iPhone with Safari. The error happens when the user tries to draw and lift their finger, causing the app to crash or become unresponsive.

First, I'll look at the patch provided. It modifies two files: tools.js and touch_manager.js. In tools.js, it adds a line to commit or remove the current drawing session when changing modes. In touch_manager.js, it adds a null check before aborting the touchMoveAC, which was causing the error.

The test needs to simulate the scenario where the error occurs. So, I'll set up a test that creates a PDF document, enables annotations, and simulates touch events for drawing. The key is to ensure that after the patch, the error doesn't occur.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules: PDFDocument, AnnotationEditorUIManager, and TouchManager. Then, I'll create a sample PDF document. Since the issue isn't document-specific, a simple one-page PDF should suffice.

Next, I'll set up the annotation editor and touch manager. I'll enable drawing tools and simulate touch events: touchstart, touchmove, and touchend. These events should trigger the drawing process and, in the case of the bug, cause the error.

The test will involve creating a promise that checks for any errors during the touch events. If the patch is correct, the promise should resolve without any errors. I'll also set a timeout to ensure the test doesn't hang indefinitely.

Finally, I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, making sure it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the fix.

```javascript
it("should not throw null error when drawing annotations", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { TouchManager } = await import("../../src/display/touch_manager.js");

  const pdfDoc = await PDFDocument.load(new Uint8Array());
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const annotationLayer = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(pdfDoc, container);
  const touchManager = new TouchManager(container);

  // Simulate touch events that would trigger the bug
  const errorPromise = new Promise(resolve => {
    try {
      const touchStartEvent = new TouchEvent("touchstart", { touches: [{}], targetTouches: [{}] });
      const touchMoveEvent = new TouchEvent("touchmove", { touches: [{}], targetTouches: [{}] });
      const touchEndEvent = new TouchEvent("touchend", { touches: [], targetTouches: [] });

      annotationLayer.enableDrawing();
      touchManager.handleEvent(touchStartEvent);
      touchManager.handleEvent(touchMoveEvent);
      touchManager.handleEvent(touchEndEvent);
      resolve();
    } catch (error) {
      resolve(error);
    }
  });

  await expect(errorPromise).resolves.toBeUndefined();

  // Cleanup
  pdfDoc.close();
  container.remove();
});
```

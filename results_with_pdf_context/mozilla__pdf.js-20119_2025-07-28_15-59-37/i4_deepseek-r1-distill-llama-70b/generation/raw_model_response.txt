Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the context menu now includes the option to highlight and comment on selected text in a PDF. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the patch provided. It seems that the `HighlightToolbar` class was renamed to `FloatingToolbar` and a new button for comments was added. So, the test needs to verify that both highlight and comment buttons are present in the context menu after selecting text.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules, like `AnnotationEditorUIManager` and `EditorToolbar`. Then, I'll set up a mock PDF document and viewer to simulate the environment.

Next, I'll create an instance of `AnnotationEditorUIManager` with the necessary parameters. I'll simulate text selection using `document.getSelection()` and ensure it's not collapsed.

After that, I'll manually trigger the display of the context menu by calling `displayFloatingToolbar`. I'll then check if the created buttons include both the highlight and comment options by looking for their respective data attributes.

If the buttons are found, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. This ensures that the patch correctly adds the new functionality to the context menu.

```javascript
it("should add highlight and comment buttons to context menu", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { EditorToolbar } = await import("../../src/display/editor/toolbar.js");

  // Setup mock PDF document and viewer
  const pdfDocument = { annotationStorage: {} };
  const viewer = { alert: {} };

  // Initialize UI manager
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(
    {} as any,
    viewer as any,
    viewer.alert as any,
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null,
    pdfDocument,
    null,
    null,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    null,
    null,
    false
  );

  // Simulate text selection
  const selection = document.getSelection();
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.selectNode(document.createElement("div"));
  selection.removeRange(range);
  selection.addRange(range);

  // Display context menu
  const textLayer = {} as any;
  await uiManager.displayFloatingToolbar();

  // Check for highlight and comment buttons
  const highlightButton = document.querySelector("[data-l10n-id='pdfjs-highlight-floating-button1']");
  const commentButton = document.querySelector("[data-l10n-id='pdfjs-comment-floating-button']");

  expect(highlightButton).toBeTruthy();
  expect(commentButton).toBeTruthy();
});
```

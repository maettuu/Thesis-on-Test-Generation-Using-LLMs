Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where a new context menu entry was added to highlight and comment on text selection in a PDF. The patch provided makes several changes, so I need to ensure that the test will fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the HighlightToolbar was renamed to FloatingToolbar. Also, a new method called commentSelection was added, and the highlightSelection method now accepts an additional parameter for commenting.

In the test, I need to simulate selecting text and then check if both the highlight and comment options are available in the context menu. Before the patch, the comment option wouldn't be present, so the test should fail. After the patch, both should be present, so the test passes.

I'll use the existing test setup from the provided test file. I'll import the necessary modules like AnnotationEditorUIManager and others. Then, I'll set up a fake PDF document and viewer to create an instance of AnnotationEditorUIManager.

Next, I'll simulate text selection using document.getSelection(). After that, I'll trigger a contextmenu event on the selected text. This should open the context menu with the new options.

I'll check if the UI manager has the methods highlightSelection and commentSelection. Since the patch adds these, the test should now find them and pass.

So, the test will create the manager, simulate the context menu, and assert that both methods exist. This ensures that the new functionality is correctly implemented.

  const viewer = {
    get pages() {

  // Create UI manager with necessary dependencies
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(

  const selection = document.getSelection();
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.selectNodeContents(document.createElement("div"));
  selection.addRange(range);
  
  // Trigger context menu
  const contextMenuEvent = new Event("contextmenu");
  document.dispatchEvent(contextMenuEvent);
  
  // Verify both highlight and comment options are present
  const expectedMethods = ["highlightSelection", "commentSelection"];
  const actualMethods = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(uiManager)
    .filter(name => expectedMethods.includes(name))
    .sort();
  
  expect(actualMethods).toEqual(expectedMethods);
});

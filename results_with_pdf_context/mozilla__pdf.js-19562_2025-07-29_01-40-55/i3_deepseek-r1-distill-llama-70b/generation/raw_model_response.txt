Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where some Russian characters aren't rendering correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, specifically adding a bunch of entries to the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds mappings for Cyrillic characters, which are probably the ones that were missing before. So, the test needs to verify that these characters are now correctly rendered.

I'll start by looking at the existing test file, test/unit/api_spec.js. It imports several modules, including getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams, which I can use to load the PDF. The test will need to open the provided PDF file, render it, and check if the text is correctly extracted.

I remember that in PDF.js, text extraction can be done using the getPageTextContent method. So, I'll need to get the first page, extract its text, and then check for the presence of specific Russian characters.

I should choose a string that's in the PDF and contains the problematic characters. For example, if the PDF has the text "Русские字符", I can check if that string appears in the extracted text.

The test structure will be an it block with an async function. I'll import the necessary modules, set up the PDF document, load the page, extract the text, and then assert that the expected string is present.

I also need to make sure that the test fails before the patch is applied. Without the patch, the extracted text might have incorrect or missing characters, so the assertion would fail. After applying the patch, the text should be correct, making the test pass.

I'll use the TEST_PDFS_PATH to point to the issue19550.pdf file. The buildGetDocumentParams function will help set up the document loader. Then, I'll create a render task to ensure the page is rendered, though maybe I don't need to render it since I'm just extracting text.

Wait, actually, for text extraction, I might not need to render the page. The getPageTextContent method should work as long as the page is loaded. So, I'll load the document, get the first page, and then extract the text.

I should handle any potential errors, maybe using try-catch, but in the test, if something goes wrong, it should fail. 

Putting it all together, the test will import the necessary functions, load the PDF, extract the text from the first page, and check if the expected Russian string is present. If it is, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to use async/await properly and to clean up any created elements to avoid memory leaks.

```javascript
it("should render Russian characters correctly in PDFs", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19550.pdf'));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  const expectedString = "Русские символы";
  assert.includes(textContent.items[0].str, expectedString, `Expected string: ${expectedString}`);
  await pdf.destroy();
});
```

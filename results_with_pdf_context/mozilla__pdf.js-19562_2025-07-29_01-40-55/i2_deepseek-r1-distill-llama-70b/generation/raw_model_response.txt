Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some Russian characters can't render correctly in pdf.js. The problem was fixed by extending the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts with Cyrillic entries. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds several entries to the t object in getGlyphMapForStandardFonts, specifically from t[570] to t[600], each mapping to a Unicode value from 1040 to 1070. These correspond to Cyrillic characters.

So, the test needs to verify that before the patch, these characters weren't rendering correctly, and after the patch, they do. 

I'll use the provided PDF file, issue19550.pdf, which contains the problematic characters. The test will load this PDF and check if the text is correctly extracted. 

I'll use the getDocument function from the API to load the PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and extract its text. 

The expected text should include the correct Cyrillic characters. Since the exact content isn't provided, I'll assume the expected string contains the correct Unicode characters, like "Русский текст". 

Before the patch, the extracted text might have incorrect or missing characters. After the patch, it should match the expected string.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically. Then, I'll load the document, get the first page, and extract the text. Finally, I'll compare the extracted text with the expected string.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll also handle any potential errors, like if the PDF fails to load.

Putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, extract the text, and assert that it matches the expected result. This should fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the fix.

```javascript
it("should correctly render Russian characters in PDFs", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19550.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
    const pdfPage = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
    const textContent = await pdfPage.getTextContent();
    
    const expectedText = "Русский текст"; // Adjust based on actual content in issue19550.pdf
    const actualText = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join('');
    
    expect(actualText).toContain(expectedText);
  } finally {
    if (loadingTask.pdfDocument) {
      await loadingTask.pdfDocument.destroy();
    }
  }
});
```

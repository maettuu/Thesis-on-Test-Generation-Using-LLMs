Okay, so I need to write a regression test for this PDF.js issue where some Russian characters aren't rendering correctly. The user provided a patch that updates the standard_fonts.js file, adding a bunch of new entries to the glyph map. My test should fail before the patch and pass after applying it.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The issue is that certain Russian characters are showing as unknown letters. The patch adds more mappings in the glyph map, which probably fixes the rendering.

I need to create a test that checks if these characters render correctly. So, the test will load the provided PDF and check the text in a specific page.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules: getDocument from api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll load the PDF using these functions.

Next, I'll get the first page of the document and its text content. I'll extract the text from the page and check if it contains the expected Russian text. If the text is rendered correctly, the test should pass.

But wait, how do I know the exact text to expect? The user provided an image, but since I can't see it, I'll assume the expected text includes certain Russian characters. For example, maybe it's "Русский текст". I'll use that as the expected string.

So, in the test, I'll get the actual text from the PDF and see if it includes the expected string. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll use async/await for loading the document and page, and then extract the text.

Putting it all together, the test will look something like this: load the PDF, get the first page, extract the text, and check for the expected Russian string.

I should also handle any potential errors, maybe with try-catch, but the example structure doesn't include that, so I'll keep it simple for now.

So, the test will import the necessary functions, load the PDF, extract the text, and assert that the expected string is present. This should ensure that the patch correctly fixes the rendering issue.

```javascript
it("should render Russian characters correctly in the PDF", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19550.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDoc = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  
  const expectedText = "Русский текст";
  expect(textContent.items[0].str).toContain(expectedText);
});
```

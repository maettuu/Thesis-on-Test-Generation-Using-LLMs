Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF text is rendering incorrectly. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file by adding mappings for GillSansMT fonts to Helvetica. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds four new entries to the non-standard font map, mapping GillSansMT variants to corresponding Helvetica fonts. This suggests that before the patch, GillSansMT fonts were not being substituted correctly, leading to incorrect text rendering.

So, the test should check if the text is rendered correctly after applying the patch. To do this, I'll need to load the provided PDF file, extract the text, and compare it against the expected output.

I'll structure the test using Jest. The test will be self-contained, so I'll use dynamic imports to get the necessary modules. I'll import getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js to load the PDF.

Next, I'll create a function to extract text from a page. This function will handle the loading of the page, process the content, and extract the text data. I'll use the getTextContent method and process the items to get the actual text.

I'll load the PDF file and extract the text from the first page. Then, I'll define the expected text based on what the correct rendering should be. For example, if the PDF has text that was previously rendered as incorrect characters, the expected text should be the correct version.

Finally, I'll compare the actual text with the expected text using expect(actualText).toBe(expectedText). This will ensure that after the patch, the text is rendered correctly.

I need to make sure that the test is concise and only tests the specific issue. I won't add any unnecessary steps or checks. The test will fail before the patch because the text extraction would return incorrect characters, and pass after the patch because the text will be correct.

I should also handle any potential asynchronous operations properly, using async/await to ensure that the PDF is loaded and the text is extracted correctly before making the comparison.

So, putting it all together, the test will import the necessary modules, load the PDF, extract the text, and assert that the actual text matches the expected text.

```javascript
it("should correctly render GillSansMT fonts as Helvetica", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const { getStandardFontName } = await import('../../src/core/standard_fonts.js');

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18801.pdf'));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const text = await page.getTextContent();
  
  function extractTextFromItems(items) {
    return items.map(item => item.str).join('');
  }

  const actualText = extractTextFromItems(text.items);
  const expectedText = "Correct Text Rendering";

  expect(actualText).toBe(expectedText);
});
```

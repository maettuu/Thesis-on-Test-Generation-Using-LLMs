Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where OpenJPEG warnings don't respect the PDF.js verbosity levels. The patch provided modifies the JpxImage.decode method to pass the 'warn' function from PDF.js's util.js. So, the goal is to ensure that after the patch, OpenJPEG warnings use the correct verbosity level.

First, I should understand how the code worked before and after the patch. Before, OpenJPEG warnings were directly logged using console.warn, which bypassed PDF.js's verbosity settings. After the patch, the 'warn' function from util.js is passed to OpenJPEG, so it should respect the verbosity.

To test this, I need to:

1. Set the verbosity level to a specific value, say 'none' to suppress warnings.
2. Decode a JPX image using JpxImage.decode.
3. Check if any warnings were logged, which they shouldn't be if the verbosity is set to 'none'.

I'll use a test JPX file. I'll create a test that sets the verbosity to 'none', then tries to decode the image. I'll mock or check the console.warn to see if it's called. If it's not called, the test passes.

I'll import the necessary modules: util.js for setVerbosityLevel and JpxImage from jpx.js. I'll also import the test JPX file, maybe from a test data URL.

In the test, I'll set the verbosity to 'none', then call JpxImage.decode. I'll wrap this in a function and check if any warnings are emitted. Since the patch passes the 'warn' function, which respects the verbosity, no warnings should be logged.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, making it async. I'll use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions, but since the test is about warnings, I'm more interested in whether console.warn is called.

I'll need to mock console.warn to track if it's called. Alternatively, I can check the internal state of the warning function. But since this is a regression test, using a spy on console.warn should work.

So, the steps in the test are:

- Import necessary modules.
- Set verbosity to 'none'.
- Mock console.warn.
- Decode the test JPX file.
- Assert that console.warn was not called.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and no new dependencies. The test will fail before the patch because console.warn would be called, and pass after because it won't be.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should respect verbosity level when decoding JPX images", async () => {
  const { setVerbosityLevel, VerbosityLevel } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const testJpxFile = await import("../../test/data/jpx/test.jpx");

  setVerbosityLevel(VerbosityLevel.none);

  const consoleWarnSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'warn').mockImplementation(() => {});

  try {
    await JpxImage.decode(await testJpxFile.arrayBuffer());
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeUndefined();
  }

  expect(consoleWarnSpy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  consoleWarnSpy.mockRestore();
});
```

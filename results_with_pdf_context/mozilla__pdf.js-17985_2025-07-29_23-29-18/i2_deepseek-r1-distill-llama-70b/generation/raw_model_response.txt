Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where OpenJPEG warnings don't respect the PDF.js verbosity levels. The patch changes the import in jpx.js to include 'warn' from '../shared/util.js' and passes it to the OpenJPEG constructor. 

So, the problem before the patch was that any warnings from OpenJPEG were logged directly using console.warn, which doesn't respect the PDF.js verbosity settings. After the patch, OpenJPEG should use the PDF.js 'warn' function, which should honor the verbosity level.

To test this, I need to simulate a scenario where OpenJPEG emits a warning and check if it's logged correctly based on the verbosity. 

I'll start by setting up a test case using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules: JpxImage from '../../src/core/jpx.js' and the util module for setVerbosityLevel and the warn function.

I'll set the verbosity level to 'none' so that warnings should be disabled. Then, I'll create a spy for the warn function to see if it's called when decoding a file that triggers a warning.

I'll need a sample JPX file that causes OpenJPEG to emit a warning. For example, a file with an unsupported feature. I'll use fetch to get this file, read it as an array buffer, and then call JpxImage.decode with ignoreColorSpace as false.

If the patch works, when the verbosity is set to 'none', the warn function shouldn't be called. But if I set the verbosity to 'info' or 'debug', the warn should be triggered.

Wait, actually, the warn function in PDF.js is only called when the verbosity level is high enough. So, if the verbosity is 'none', warnings are not shown. So in the test, I can set the verbosity to 'none' and expect that no warning is emitted. Alternatively, I can set it to 'info' and expect a warning.

But since the issue is that warnings were being logged regardless of the verbosity, the test should ensure that with the patch, the warnings respect the verbosity setting.

So, perhaps the test should check both scenarios: when verbosity is 'none' and when it's 'info'. But since the test needs to be self-contained and to the point, maybe just test one scenario where the warning is not emitted when verbosity is 'none'.

Alternatively, the test can verify that the warn function is called only when the verbosity allows it. But for simplicity, let's focus on the case where with the patch, the warning is not logged when verbosity is 'none'.

So, in the test, I'll:

1. Import JpxImage and util.
2. Mock the console.warn to track if it's called.
3. Set the verbosity level to 'none'.
4. Decode a JPX file that triggers a warning.
5. Check if the warn function was called or not.

Wait, but the patch uses the 'warn' function from util.js, which might not directly call console.warn. So, perhaps the test should check if the 'warn' function from util is called, not the console's.

Hmm, that's a good point. So, in the test, I should spy on the 'warn' function imported from '../shared/util.js' to see if it's called when decoding.

So, the steps are:

- Import JpxImage and { setVerbosityLevel, warn } from util.
- Create a spy on the warn function.
- Set the verbosity level to 'none'.
- Decode a JPX file that causes a warning.
- Assert that the warn function was not called.

If the patch is correct, with verbosity 'none', the warn function shouldn't be invoked. So, the test should pass because the warning is suppressed.

But how do I get a JPX file that triggers a warning? Maybe I can create a test file that's known to cause OpenJPEG to emit a warning. Alternatively, perhaps I can simulate the condition in the code, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a valid JPX file and check that under normal decoding, no warning is emitted. But that might not cover the case where a warning is supposed to be logged.

Wait, the issue is that any OpenJPEG warning was logged directly, ignoring the verbosity. So, the test needs to trigger an OpenJPEG warning and ensure that it's only logged if the verbosity is set to allow it.

So, the test will:

1. Set verbosity to 'none' and ensure that when a warning occurs, the warn function isn't called.
2. Or set verbosity to 'info' and ensure that the warn function is called.

But to make the test fail before the patch, after the patch it should pass. So, perhaps the test will check that when the verbosity is 'none', no warning is logged.

So, in code:

Import the necessary modules.

Set the verbosity level to 'none'.

Spy on the warn function.

Decode a JPX file that causes a warning.

Expect that the warn function was not called.

But before the patch, the warn function would have been called regardless of the verbosity, so the test would fail. After the patch, with verbosity 'none', the warn function isn't called, so the test passes.

So, the test is designed to fail before the patch and pass after.

Now, I need to write the code.

I'll structure the test as an async function. I'll import JpxImage and util.

I'll set the verbosity level to 'none' using setVerbosityLevel.

Then, I'll create a spy on the warn function.

I'll fetch a JPX file that causes a warning. For example, using a sample file from the tests or a known problematic file.

Wait, but in the test, I can't use external URLs because of cross-origin issues. So, perhaps I can create an in-memory JPX file that would trigger a warning. Alternatively, use a base64 encoded string.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a test file that's part of the PDF.js test suite. But since I don't have access to that, I'll have to simulate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can pass an invalid JPX file that would cause OpenJPEG to emit a warning. For example, an empty buffer or a corrupted file.

But in the test, I can create a sample JPX file as an ArrayBuffer.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a known good file and force a condition that triggers a warning, like setting an option that causes OpenJPEG to warn.

Wait, looking back at the patch, the OpenJPEG instance is created with { warn }, so perhaps when the OpenJPEG library emits a warning, it uses the provided warn function.

So, in the test, after the patch, when the OpenJPEG library emits a warning, it will call the warn function from util.js, which respects the verbosity level.

So, the test can proceed as follows:

- Set the verbosity to 'none'.
- Spy on the warn function.
- Decode a file that causes a warning.
- Assert that the warn function was not called.

Before the patch, the warn function would have been called, so the test would fail. After the patch, it won't be called, so the test passes.

So, the code would look like:

it("should respect verbosity level for OpenJPEG warnings", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const { setVerbosityLevel, warn } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  
  setVerbosityLevel("none");
  const spy = jest.spyOn(warn, 'warn'); // Wait, no, the warn function is a function, so the spy should be on the function itself.

  // Or perhaps:
  const originalWarn = warn.warn;
  warn.warn = jest.fn();
  
  // Or maybe the util.js's warn is a function that can be spied.

  // Alternatively, perhaps the warn function is a named export, so:
  const { warn: utilWarn } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  const spy = jest.spyOn(utilWarn, 'warn');

  // Then, after setting verbosity to 'none', decode a file that causes a warning.

  // Fetch a sample JPX file that causes a warning.
  const response = await fetch("path_to_sample_jpx_file.jpx");
  const data = await response.arrayBuffer();

  await JpxImage.decode(data);

  expect(spy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

Wait, but in the util.js, the exports include 'warn' as a function. So, when we import it, we can spy on it.

So, in the test, after setting the verbosity level, any call to warn should respect the level.

But I'm not sure if setting the verbosity level affects the warn function's behavior. The 'warn' function in util.js probably checks the current verbosity level before logging.

So, the test should correctly reflect that when verbosity is 'none', the warn function doesn't log anything.

So, the test will:

- Set the verbosity level to 'none'.
- Spy on the warn function.
- Decode a file that causes OpenJPEG to emit a warning.
- Assert that the warn function was not called.

But to make this work, the test needs to have a file that causes a warning. Alternatively, perhaps the test can pass an option to OpenJPEG that triggers a warning.

But perhaps the simplest way is to use a valid file and assume that during decoding, a warning is emitted. Or perhaps, the test can pass an invalid parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can create a situation where the OpenJPEG library emits a warning, such as passing a corrupted file.

But for the sake of the test, perhaps using a sample file that is known to cause a warning when decoded.

But since I can't include external files, I'll have to create an in-memory sample. Alternatively, perhaps the test can create a minimal JPX file that triggers a warning.

Alternatively, perhaps I can pass a zero-length array buffer, but that might throw an error instead of a warning.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to have a test file that's valid but causes a warning. But without knowing the specifics, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can call the decode function with a parameter that triggers a warning, such as setting ignoreColorSpace to true or another option.

Wait, looking at the OpenJPEG documentation, perhaps certain decoding options can cause warnings. For example, if the image uses a feature that's not supported, OpenJPEG might warn.

But without knowing the exact conditions, perhaps the test can proceed by assuming that the decode function will trigger a warning under certain conditions.

So, the test will:

- Import JpxImage and the util functions.
- Set the verbosity to 'none'.
- Spy on the warn function.
- Decode a sample JPX file.
- Expect that the warn function wasn't called.

But before the patch, the warn function would have been called, causing the test to fail. After the patch, it won't be called, so the test passes.

So, the code would look like:

it("should not log OpenJPEG warnings when verbosity is none", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const { setVerbosityLevel, warn } = await import("../../shared/util.js");

  setVerbosityLevel("none");
  const spy = jest.spyOn(warn, "warn");

  // Fetch or create a sample JPX file
  const sampleJpxFile = new ArrayBuffer(0); // This might not be sufficient, but for the test's sake.

  try {
    await JpxImage.decode(sampleJpxFile);
  } catch (error) {
    // If the file is invalid, an error might be thrown, but we're interested in warnings.
  }

  expect(spy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

Wait, but in reality, the sample file might cause an error instead of a warning. So, perhaps the test should use a valid file that doesn't cause an error but does cause a warning.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a file that's known to cause a warning, such as having an unsupported color space.

But without access to such a file, perhaps the test can proceed as is, assuming that the decode function will emit a warning.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a valid JPX file and check that no warning is emitted when verbosity is 'none'.

But the main point is that before the patch, any warning would be logged via console.warn, which the test can detect by checking if the spy was called. After the patch, the warning should respect the verbosity.

So, the test should correctly capture this behavior.

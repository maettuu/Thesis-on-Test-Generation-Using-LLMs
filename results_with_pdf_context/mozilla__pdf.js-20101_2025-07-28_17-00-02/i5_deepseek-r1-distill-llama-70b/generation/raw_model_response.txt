Okay, I need to write a regression test for the given issue where text isn't shown when `browser.display.use_document_fonts` is set to 0 in Firefox. The test should fail before the patch and pass after applying the patch. 

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user provided a PDF where some text is hidden, showing only spaces. This happens because the browser isn't using the document's embedded fonts. The patch modifies `canvas.js` to skip empty paths and handle missing fonts better.

I should create a test that checks if all the text is rendered correctly when `disableFontFace` is true. The test will load the PDF, render it, and check for any missing text indicators.

I'll use the provided PDF file `issue20065.pdf`. The test will:

1. Set `browser.display.use_document_fonts` to 0.
2. Load the PDF using `getDocument`.
3. Render the first page.
4. Check if any text is missing by looking for 'Missing' in the text items.

If the patch works, no text should be missing, so the test should pass. Before the patch, some text would be missing, causing the test to fail.

I'll structure the test using `it` from Jest. I'll import necessary modules dynamically to ensure compatibility. The test will be self-contained, using the provided PDF and checking the text content.

I need to make sure the test doesn't have any new dependencies and uses only the provided imports. I'll also handle any potential errors during loading or rendering.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's concise and directly addresses the issue.

```javascript
it("should render all text when document fonts are disabled", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue20065.pdf'));
  
  const { numPages, page } = await loadingTask;
  const page1 = await numPages.waitForPage(1);
  const textContent = await page1.getTextContent();
  
  const missingText = textContent.items.some(item => item.str === 'Missing');
  expect(missingText).toBe(false);
});
```

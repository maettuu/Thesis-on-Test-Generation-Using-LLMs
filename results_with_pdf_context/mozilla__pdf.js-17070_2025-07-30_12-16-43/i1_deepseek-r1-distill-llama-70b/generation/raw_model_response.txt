Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where comments and sticky notes aren't rendered in the PDF.js viewer. The user provided a patch that modifies the annotation.js file, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file, annotation_spec.js. It imports necessary modules and sets up some test utilities. I can use these imports to create a new test case.

The test should load the provided PDF file, issue17069.pdf. I'll use getDocument from display/api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js to set this up. Once the document is loaded, I'll get the first page and render it.

I need to check if the annotations (like comments and sticky notes) are rendered. Perhaps I can check the number of annotations or their properties. But since the issue is about rendering, maybe I should verify that the expected HTML elements are created.

Wait, in the patch, the noHTML flag is set to false for certain annotations. So, after the patch, these annotations should have their HTML rendered. I can check if the annotationLayer contains the expected elements.

I'll create the test case using Jest's it function. The test will:

1. Import necessary modules dynamically.
2. Load the PDF document.
3. Get the first page and its annotation layer.
4. Check if the expected number of annotations are present and rendered.

I need to ensure that the test fails before the patch because the annotations aren't rendered, and passes after because they are. So, I'll count the annotations and their HTML elements.

I'll structure the test with async/await for loading the document and page. Then, I'll get the annotation layer and check the length and content.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should render comment and sticky note annotations", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17069.pdf'));
  
  const { numPages, pages } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pages.open(0);
  
  const annotationLayer = await page.annotationLayer;
  const annotations = await annotationLayer.getAnnotations();
  
  expect(annotations.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  const annotation = annotations[0];
  expect(annotation instanceof TextAnnotation).toBe(true);
  expect(annotation.data.noHTML).toBe(false);
});
```

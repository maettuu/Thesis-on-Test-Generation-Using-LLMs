Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where elements like comments and sticky notes aren't being displayed in the PDF viewer after the patch was applied. The user provided a PDF file, issue17069.pdf, which has these annotations. 

First, I should understand the problem. The issue is that after updating PDF.js, certain annotations aren't rendering. The patch modifies the noHTML flag in several annotation classes. The noHTML flag determines whether HTML is rendered for the annotation. If it's set incorrectly, the annotations might not show up.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll write a test that checks if the annotations are rendered correctly.

I'll use the provided PDF file. The test will open this PDF and check if the expected annotations are present. 

I'll use the getDocument function from the display API to load the PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and render it. After rendering, I'll check the annotations.

I need to import the necessary modules dynamically. I'll use getDocument from '../../src/display/api.js' and buildGetDocumentParams from './test_utils.js'.

In the test, I'll create a loading task for the PDF. Once loaded, I'll get the first page and its annotations. I'll check if there are any annotations and if they are of the expected types, like 'text' or 'popup'.

I'll set a timeout to allow the PDF to load and render. Then, I'll make assertions to ensure that annotations exist and are of the correct type.

So, the test will look something like this: load the PDF, get the page, check for annotations, and ensure they're present and correct.

```javascript
it("should render annotations with correct HTML handling", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17069.pdf'));
  
  const { numPages, page } = await loadingTask;
  await page.render();
  
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  const expectedAnnotationTypes = ['text', 'popup'];
  
  expect(annotations.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(annotations[0].data.annotationType)).toBe(AnnotationType.TEXT);
  expect(annotations[1].data.annotationType)).toBe(AnnotationType.POPUP);
});
```

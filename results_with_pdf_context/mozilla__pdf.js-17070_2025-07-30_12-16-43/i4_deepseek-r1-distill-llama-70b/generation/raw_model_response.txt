Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the comments and sticky notes are rendered correctly in the PDF viewer after applying the patch. The user provided a patch that modifies the annotation.js file, and the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll start by understanding the issue. The user mentioned that in PDF.js versions 4.0.10 and 3.11.174, the comments and sticky notes aren't rendered, but they work in version 2.5.207. So the patch is supposed to fix this regression.

Looking at the patch, I see several changes. The key part is setting `this.data.noHTML = false;` in the TextAnnotation constructor. This suggests that the `noHTML` flag was preventing the HTML rendering of these annotations, so setting it to false should allow them to appear.

Now, I need to write a test that verifies this behavior. The test should load the provided PDF, which has a sticky note, and check if the annotation is rendered.

I'll structure the test using Jest. The test will:

1. Import the necessary modules, like `getDocument` from the display API and `buildGetDocumentParams` from test utilities.
2. Load the PDF document using `getDocument` with the provided file path.
3. Get the first page of the document.
4. Render the page and check for annotations.
5. Specifically, look for a TextAnnotation and verify that its `noHTML` flag is set to false, ensuring it's rendered.

I'll use `await` to handle the asynchronous operations. I'll also make sure to destroy the document after the test to clean up resources.

The test will fail before the patch because the `noHTML` flag would be true, preventing rendering. After the patch, the flag is set to false, so the test should pass.

I'll write the test in a self-contained manner, ensuring it only checks the specific condition related to the sticky note rendering. This way, it's concise and directly addresses the issue without unnecessary complexity.

```javascript
it("should render sticky note annotations", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17069.pdf'));
  
  const { doc, page } = await loadingTask;
  await doc.load();
  await page.load();
  await page.render();
  
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  const textAnnotation = annotations.find(annotation => annotation instanceof TextAnnotation);
  
  expect(textAnnotation.data.noHTML).toBe(false);
  
  await doc.destroy();
});
```

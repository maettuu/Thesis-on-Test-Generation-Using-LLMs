Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where SVG images can't be resized in pdf.js. The patch provided adds a method to check if SVGs fit in the canvas and modifies how SVG URLs are handled. 

First, I'll look at the test file provided. It's test/unit/annotation_spec.js, which already imports some modules. I can use this file to write the test.

The test should fail before the patch and pass after. So, I need to simulate adding an SVG image and check if it can be resized.

I'll create a test SVG with a red rectangle. Then, I'll create an ImageManager instance and try to get the image data. 

I'll use the ImageManager's #get method with the SVG data. If the SVG can't be resized, the aspect ratio might not be preserved, causing the image to not fit the canvas.

I'll set up a canvas to draw the image. After drawing, I'll check the pixel color to see if it's red. If it's not, the image didn't fit properly.

I'll use async/await for the image loading and processing. 

I'll structure the test with Jest's it block. I'll import necessary modules like ImageManager from the correct path. Then, I'll create the SVG data URL, use ImageManager to get the image, draw it on a canvas, and check the pixel data.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses existing imports or imports dynamically as needed. 

I think the test should check if the image, when drawn, correctly fills the canvas without preserving the aspect ratio, which would mean the resize works as intended.

```javascript
it("should resize SVG images correctly", async () => {
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const svgData = `<svg viewBox="0 0 1 1" width="1" height="1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="1" height="1" style="fill:red;"/></svg>`;
  const svgUrl = `data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,${encodeURIComponent(svgData)}`;
  
  const imageManager = new ImageManager();
  const image = await imageManager.#get(svgUrl, null);
  
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(1, 1);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.drawImage(image.bitmap, 0, 0, 1, 1);
  
  const pixels = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
  const isRed = pixels[0] === 255 && pixels[1] === 0 && pixels[2] === 0;
  
  expect(isRed).toBe(true);
});
```

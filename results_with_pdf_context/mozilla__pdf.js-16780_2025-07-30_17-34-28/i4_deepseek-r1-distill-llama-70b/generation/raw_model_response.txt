Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where SVG images couldn't be resized in pdf.js. The patch provided is supposed to fix this by adjusting how SVGs are handled when drawing on a canvas.

First, I'll look at the patch. It adds a method _checkIfSVGFitsInCanvas which checks if an SVG image can be resized without preserving the aspect ratio. If it can't, it appends a specific URL fragment to the SVG URL. This should fix the resizing issue.

So, the test needs to verify that after the patch, resizing an SVG image works correctly. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create a test SVG and try to draw it on a canvas with different dimensions. I'll check if the image is resized properly.

I'll import the necessary modules, including the ImageManager from the patched file. Then, I'll create an SVG image, use the ImageManager to load it, and draw it on a canvas. I'll read the pixel data to see if the resizing was successful.

The test will have two cases: one where the aspect ratio is preserved and another where it's not. This ensures that the SVG is resized correctly in both scenarios.

I'll write the test so that it initializes the ImageManager, loads the SVG, and then checks the pixel data after drawing. If the pixel data matches the expected resized dimensions, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import the ImageManager to avoid any issues with Node.js dependencies.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's concise and directly addresses the issue without unnecessary comments or explanations.

```javascript
it("should resize SVG images correctly after patch", async () => {
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const imageManager = new ImageManager();

  const svg = `data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="100" height="100" style="fill:red;"/></svg>`;
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = svg;
  await image.decode();

  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(50, 25);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, 50, 25);

  const pixelData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
  const isRed = pixelData[0] === 255 && pixelData[1] === 0 && pixelData[2] === 0;
  expect(isRed).toBe(true);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch fixes the issue where only one image is rendered in the provided PDF. The user mentioned that the problem occurs because the PDF has inlined images without the closing 'EI' operator. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The patch adds a try-catch block around the code that processes inline images. This means that if an error occurs while decoding an image, it will be caught, and a warning will be logged instead of stopping the entire process. 

So, before the patch, if an image fails to decode, it might cause the rendering to stop, resulting in only one image being displayed. After the patch, the decoder should skip the problematic image and continue rendering the others.

To test this, I'll create a test that loads the problematic PDF and checks if more than one image is rendered. I'll use the 'getDocument' function from pdf.js to load the PDF and count the number of images rendered.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, load the PDF, and set up event listeners to count the number of 'end' events triggered when each page is rendered. Since the PDF has only one page, I'll wait for that event and then check the number of images.

I'll use the 'getDocument' function with the provided PDF file and set up a promise to wait for the page to finish rendering. Once the page is rendered, I'll check if the number of images is greater than one. If it is, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll use the imports as specified and structure the test to be concise and focused on verifying the fix.

```javascript
it("should render all images in PDF with missing EI", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17794.pdf'));
  const { pdfDocument } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  
  let imageCount = 0;
  const pageRendered = new Promise(resolve => {
    page.on('end', () => {
      imageCount++;
      resolve();
    });
  });

  await page.render();
  await pageRendered;

  expect(imageCount).toBeGreaterThan(1);
});
```

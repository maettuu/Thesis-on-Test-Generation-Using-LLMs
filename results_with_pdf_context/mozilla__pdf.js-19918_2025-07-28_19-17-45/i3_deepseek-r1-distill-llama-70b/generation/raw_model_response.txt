Okay, I need to write a test for the issue where CMYK JPEG images aren't decoding correctly using the ImageDecoder. The patch adds support for this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file to see what's available. It imports several modules, but I might need to import JpegImage and JpegStream from their respective files. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports with require.

I'll create a test case that checks if a CMYK JPEG can be decoded. I'll need a sample CMYK JPEG file, maybe from the test resources. I'll set up a fetch to get this file and process it using JpegImage.

In the test, I'll parse the data and check if the number of components is 4, indicating CMYK. Then, I'll attempt to use ImageDecoder. If it's supported, the image should decode without errors.

I'll structure the test with async/await for the fetch and JpegImage.parse. I'll also handle any exceptions that might be thrown during parsing.

Finally, I'll assert that the image dimensions are correct and that the components are decoded properly, ensuring the test passes only after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should decode cmyk jpeg image using ImageDecoder", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = require("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const response = await fetch(`${getCrossOriginHostname()}/${TEST_PDFS_PATH}cmyc.jpg`);
  const data = await response.arrayBuffer();
  const uint8Data = new Uint8Array(data);
  
  let image;
  try {
    image = new JpegImage();
    await image.parse(uint8Data);
  } catch (ex) {
    throw new Error("JpegImage.parse failed: " + ex.message);
  }
  
  const useImageDecoder = JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder(uint8Data);
  if (!useImageDecoder) {
    throw new Error("ImageDecoder is not supported");
  }
  
  const expectedWidth = 200;
  const expectedHeight = 200;
  assert.equal(image.width, expectedWidth, "Width is incorrect");
  assert.equal(image.height, expectedHeight, "Height is incorrect");
  assert.equal(image.numComponents, 4, "Number of components should be 4 for CMYK");
});
```

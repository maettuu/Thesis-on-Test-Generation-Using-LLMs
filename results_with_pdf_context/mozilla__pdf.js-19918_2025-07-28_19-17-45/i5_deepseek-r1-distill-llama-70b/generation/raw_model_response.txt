Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF.js couldn't decode CMYK JPEG images using the ImageDecoder. The patch adds support for this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll create a test that checks if a CMYK JPEG image is correctly decoded. I'll use a sample CMYK JPEG image, maybe from the test_pdfs folder.

I'll import the necessary modules: JpegImage from jpg.js and JpegStream from jpeg_stream.js. Then, I'll fetch the sample image data.

Next, I'll analyze the image using JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder to see if it's recognized as CMYK. Before the patch, this should return null because CMYK wasn't supported, so the test would fail. After the patch, it should return an object with cmyk: true.

In the test, I'll call canUseImageDecoder on the data and check if the result has cmyk set to true. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, making it async since I'm fetching data. I'll also handle any errors that might occur during the fetch.

So, the test will import the necessary modules, fetch the image data, analyze it, and assert that cmyk is supported. This should ensure that the patch correctly enables CMYK decoding with ImageDecoder.

```javascript
it("should decode CMYK JPEG images using ImageDecoder", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  
  // Use a known CMYK JPEG image for testing
  const response = await fetch("../../test_pdfs/cmyk.jpg");
  const data = await response.arrayBuffer();
  
  // Analyze the image to check for CMYK support
  const result = await JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder(data);
  
  // The test passes if CMYK is properly detected and supported
  expect(result.cmyk).toBe(true);
});
```

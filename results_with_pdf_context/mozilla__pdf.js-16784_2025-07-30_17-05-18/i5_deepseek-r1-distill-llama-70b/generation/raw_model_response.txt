Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where SVG images can't be resized in pdf.js. The patch provided changes the method name from _checkIfSVGFitsInCanvas to _isSVGFittingCanvas and makes it a getter. So, the test should check if after the patch, SVG images can be resized correctly.

First, I'll create an SVG image with a specific size. Then, I'll load it into a canvas and check if resizing works. Before the patch, the test should fail because the image doesn't resize. After the patch, it should pass.

I'll use the ImageManager class to handle the image. I'll create a test SVG with a red rectangle. Then, I'll set its dimensions and draw it on a canvas. I'll check the pixel color to see if the image was resized correctly.

I'll import the necessary modules, create the SVG, load it using ImageManager, and then draw it on a canvas with a smaller size. If the pixel color changes, it means resizing worked. I'll compare the expected color after resizing to the actual color.

So, the test will create an SVG, load it, draw it on a canvas, and check if the resizing was applied by looking at the pixel color. If it's correct, the test passes.

```javascript
it("should correctly resize SVG images", async () => {
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const svg = `<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100"><rect width="100" height="100" fill="red"/></svg>`;
  
  // Create a test image element
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = `data:image/svg+xml,${encodeURIComponent(svg)}`;
  
  // Load the image using ImageManager
  const imageManager = new ImageManager();
  const imagePromise = imageManager.get("test", image);
  
  // Create a canvas to draw the image
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  canvas.width = 50;
  canvas.height = 50;
  
  // Draw the image on the canvas after it's loaded
  image.onload = async () => {
    const imageBitmap = await imagePromise;
    ctx.drawImage(imageBitmap, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    // Check if the image was resized correctly by checking the pixel color
    const pixel = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
    const expectedColor = [255, 0, 0, 255]; // Red color
    
    // Compare the actual pixel color with the expected color
    if (pixel.every((value, index) => value === expectedColor[index])) {
      // Resizing was successful
      console.assert(true);
    } else {
      console.assert(false, "SVG image was not resized correctly");
    }
  };
});
```

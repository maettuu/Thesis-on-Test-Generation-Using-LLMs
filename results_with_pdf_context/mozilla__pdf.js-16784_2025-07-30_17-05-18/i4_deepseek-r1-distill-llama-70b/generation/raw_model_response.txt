Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where SVG images couldn't be resized in pdf.js. The patch provided changes some method names and how SVG handling is done. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the method `_checkIfSVGFitsInCanvas` was renamed to `_isSVGFittingCanvas` and it's now a getter. The patch also modifies how the SVG URL is handled when drawing on a canvas.

So, the test needs to check if after the patch, resizing an SVG image works correctly. The test should create an SVG, draw it on a canvas, and check if the resizing affects the image.

I'll start by creating a test SVG with a red rectangle. Then, draw it on a canvas with a height larger than the SVG's height. Before the patch, the image wouldn't resize, so the drawn area would still be the original size, leaving the rest as black. After the patch, the image should resize, covering the entire canvas.

In the test, I'll create an SVG image, draw it on a 1x3 canvas. Then, check the pixel color at the bottom. If the patch works, the color should change from black to red where the SVG is resized.

I need to import the necessary modules, like `ImageManager` from the correct path. Then, create the SVG data URL and use it with `ImageManager` to get the bitmap. After drawing, extract the pixel data and check if the resized area is red.

I should structure the test with `it` block, using async/await for promises. The test should fail before the patch because the image doesn't resize, and pass after because it does.

I also need to handle any potential issues, like the image not loading correctly, but the patch should fix that.

So, the test will create an SVG, draw it on a taller canvas, and check if the bottom pixel is red, indicating proper resizing.

```javascript
it("should resize SVG images correctly when added", async () => {
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const svg = `data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,<svg viewBox="0 0 1 1" width="1" height="1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="1" height="1" style="fill:red;"/></svg>`;
  const imageManager = new ImageManager();
  
  // Create a canvas to draw the SVG
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(1, 3);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  
  // Get the image bitmap
  const image = await imageManager.getFromUrl(svg);
  
  // Draw the image on the canvas
  ctx.drawImage(image.bitmap, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3);
  
  // Check the pixel data
  const pixels = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
  const bottomPixel = ctx.getImageData(0, 2, 1, 1).data;
  
  // The bottom of the canvas should now be red due to resizing
  expect(pixels[0]).toBe(255); // Red
  expect(pixels[1]).toBe(0);   // Green
  expect(pixels[2]).toBe(0);   // Blue
  expect(bottomPixel[0]).toBe(255); // Resized area should also be red
});
```

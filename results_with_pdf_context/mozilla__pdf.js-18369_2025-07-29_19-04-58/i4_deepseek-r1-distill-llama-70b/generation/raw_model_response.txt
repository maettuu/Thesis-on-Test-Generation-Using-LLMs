Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the issue with Japanese vertical punctuation in Firefox when opening a PDF is fixed by the provided patch. 

First, I should understand the problem. The user mentioned that in Firefox, opening a specific PDF (bug1905623.pdf) shows Japanese vertical punctuation errors. The patch modifies some code in fonts.js and fonts_utils.js, adding a function to handle vertical presentation forms.

So, the test should verify that after applying the patch, the vertical punctuation is correctly displayed.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I'll need to get the PDF document using getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Also, I'll need the Glyph class from fonts.js to check the glyphs.

Next, I'll load the PDF document and get the first page. Then, I'll render the page and extract the text content. The text should include the correct vertical punctuation marks.

I'll look for specific Unicode characters that were problematic, like '，' (U+FF0D), '。' (U+FF0E), and '「' (U+FF62). These should now be rendered correctly.

I'll create an array of expected characters and check if each is present in the text content. If all are found, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll structure the test using async/await for loading the PDF and page.

Finally, I'll write the test block, ensuring it's concise and directly tests the issue without unnecessary steps.

```javascript
it("should correctly render vertical Japanese punctuation", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1905623.pdf'));
  
  const pdf = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  
  const expected = [
    '，', // U+FF0D
    '。', // U+FF0E
    '「', // U+FF62
    '」', // U+FF63
  ];
  
  const actual = textContent.items.map(item => item.str);
  expected.forEach(char => {
    if (!actual.includes(char)) {
      throw new Error(`Missing expected character: ${char}`);
    }
  });
});
```

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where opening a PDF in Firefox shows Japanese vertical punctuation errors. The patch provided is supposed to fix this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the patch. It adds a function getVerticalPresentationForm in fonts_utils.js and modifies the Font class in fonts.js to handle vertical presentation forms. The issue is related to how certain characters are displayed when the font is vertical, which is common in Japanese text.

The test should check if the vertical punctuation is correctly rendered. I'll need to open the provided PDF, bug1905623.pdf, and check the text in the first page.

I'll use the existing test setup. I'll import the necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. Then, I'll create a loading task for the PDF.

Once the document is loaded, I'll get the first page and create a text layer. I'll analyze the text items to see if the expected characters are present. The expected string should include the correct vertical versions of punctuation like the comma and period.

I'll write an async function that does this and use it in the test. The test should compare the actual text extracted from the PDF with the expected string. If they match, the test passes.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle any errors during loading.

So, the test will load the PDF, extract the text from the first page, and check if the vertical punctuation is correctly rendered. This should validate that the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly render vertical Japanese punctuation", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1905623.pdf'));

  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
    const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
    const textLayer = await page.getTextContent();
    const textItems = textLayer.items;
    const expected = "、。";
    const actual = textItems[0].str;

    expect(actual).toContain(expected);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`PDF rendering failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

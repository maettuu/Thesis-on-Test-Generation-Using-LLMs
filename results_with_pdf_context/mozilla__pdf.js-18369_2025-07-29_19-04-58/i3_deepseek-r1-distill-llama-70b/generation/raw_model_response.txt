Alright, I need to create a test for the issue where opening a PDF in Firefox shows Japanese vertical punctuation errors. The user provided a patch that modifies some files, and I need to ensure the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I'll look at the problem. The issue is with vertical punctuation in Japanese when using Firefox. The patch adds code to handle vertical presentation forms, so the test should check if these are correctly applied.

I'll start by setting up the test structure. I'll use the existing test file as a template. I'll need to import necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports.

Next, I'll load the specific PDF file, bug1905623.pdf, using getDocument. I'll set up the PDFDocument and PDFPage to access the text content.

The test should extract the text from the PDF and check for the correct punctuation. Before the patch, the punctuation might be incorrect, but after, it should be fixed.

I'll write the test to fetch the text content and compare it against the expected result. I'll use async/await for the promises and include error handling with try-catch.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external state. I'll define the expected text within the test. The actual text will be retrieved using page.getTextContent().

Finally, I'll structure the test within an it block, using the provided imports and setup. The test will fail before the patch because the punctuation is incorrect and pass after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should correctly render vertical Japanese punctuation", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams("bug1905623.pdf"));
  
  const pdf = await loadingTask;
  const pages = await pdf.getPages();
  const page = pages[0];
  
  const expectedText = "。、";
  const { textContent } = await page.getTextContent();
  
  const actualText = textContent.items[0].str;
  
  expect(actualText).toBe(expectedText);
});
```

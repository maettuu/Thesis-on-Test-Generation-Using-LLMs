Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where opening a PDF in Firefox shows Japanese vertical punctuation errors. The patch provided modifies the fonts.js and fonts_utils.js files to handle vertical presentation forms correctly.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds a function getVerticalPresentationForm that maps certain Unicode characters to their vertical counterparts. Then, in the Font class, it checks if a character is missing and if the font is vertical. If so, it replaces the character with its vertical form using the lookup table.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that opens the provided PDF and checks for the correct rendering of a specific character. The PDF in question is bug1905623.pdf, which likely contains problematic characters.

I'll use the getDocument function from the display API to load the PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and render it. After rendering, I'll extract the text from the page. The text should include a character that was previously rendered incorrectly, like the Japanese comma („ÄÅ) which should now be rendered as its vertical form.

I'll write the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, load the PDF, and check if the rendered text includes the expected vertical comma. If the patch works, the text should match; otherwise, it would fail.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses only the provided imports. I'll structure the test with an async function, load the PDF, render the page, extract the text, and assert that the expected character is present.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring that it only returns the JavaScript test without any comments or explanations beyond the code itself.

```javascript
it("should render vertical Japanese punctuation correctly in PDFs", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1905623.pdf'));
  
  const { pdfDocument } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  
  const expectedVerticalPunctuation = String.fromCharCode(0xfe11);
  expect(textContent.items[0].str).toContain(expectedVerticalPunctuation);
});
```

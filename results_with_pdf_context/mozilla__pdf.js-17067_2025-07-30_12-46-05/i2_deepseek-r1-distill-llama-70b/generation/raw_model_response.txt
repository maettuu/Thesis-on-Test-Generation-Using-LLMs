Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where applying a transform breaks the pattern. The user provided a patch that modifies the updateRectMinMax function in canvas.js. My task is to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The issue is that when a skew or rotation is applied to a rectangle, the pattern doesn't appear correctly. The patch changes how the min and max coordinates are calculated by considering all four corners of the rectangle after transformation.

So, the test needs to check if the bounding box is correctly computed after the transform. If the bounding box is wrong, the pattern might not render properly.

I'll use the provided PDF file, issue17065.pdf, which has rectangles with transforms. The test will load this PDF and check the bounding boxes of the patterns.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Import necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams.
2. Load the PDF document.
3. Get the first page and create a viewport.
4. Render the page into a canvas, which will trigger the canvas.js code.
5. After rendering, check the canvas for the expected pattern.

Wait, but how do I check the pattern? Maybe I can check if the canvas has the correct pixels. Alternatively, since the issue is about the bounding box, perhaps I can directly test the updateRectMinMax function.

But since the test needs to run in the context of the PDF.js code, maybe I can create a test that simulates the transform and rectangle, then checks the min and max values.

Alternatively, since the issue is visual, perhaps the test can capture the rendered canvas and compare it to an expected state. But that might be complex.

Another approach is to write a unit test for the updateRectMinMax function. But given the instructions, the test should be self-contained and use the provided imports, so perhaps a unit test isn't the way to go.

Wait, the example structure provided by the user shows using getDocument and building params, so I'll follow that approach.

I'll write a test that loads the PDF, renders it, and then checks if the canvas correctly displays the pattern. Since the issue is that the pattern doesn't appear when a transform is applied, after the patch, the pattern should appear.

But how to programmatically check that? Maybe I can check the number of rectangles or the pixels. Alternatively, perhaps I can check the dimensions of the rendered elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can verify that after rendering, the canvas has the expected color in certain regions. For example, check that the purple color is present in the correct area.

But without knowing the exact expected pixel values, this might be tricky. Alternatively, I can use a headless browser or a mock canvas to capture the rendering.

Wait, but in the test environment, perhaps I can create a mock canvas context and check if the fillRect or other methods are called with the correct parameters.

Hmm, but that might require more setup. Alternatively, since the patch is about the updateRectMinMax function, perhaps I can directly test that function with the given transform and rectangle.

So, I can create a test case where I call updateRectMinMax with a specific transform and rectangle, and then check if the minX, minY, maxX, maxY are correctly updated.

That sounds more straightforward. So, the test would:

1. Create an instance of CanvasExtraState with a width and height.
2. Define a rectangle and a transform (like a skew or rotation).
3. Call updateRectMinMax with the transform and rectangle.
4. Check if the minX, minY, maxX, maxY are as expected after the transformation.

This way, I can ensure that the function correctly computes the bounding box after the transform, which would fix the pattern issue.

So, the test will create a CanvasExtraState, apply a transform to a rectangle, and then assert that the min and max values are correct. Before the patch, this would fail because only two points were considered, but after the patch, all four points are considered.

I'll structure the test using Jest syntax, as that's common in PDF.js testing. The test will be an async function since it needs to import modules dynamically.

I'll also need to mock or create the necessary setup for CanvasExtraState. Since the test is self-contained, I'll import the necessary modules and set up the state manually.

So, putting it all together, the test will:

- Import the necessary modules.
- Create a CanvasExtraState instance.
- Define a rectangle and a transform (e.g., a skew).
- Call updateRectMinMax with these parameters.
- Check that minX, minY, maxX, maxY are correctly computed.

This should ensure that the patch fixes the issue, as the test would fail before the patch and pass after.

```javascript
it("should correctly compute bounding box for transformed rectangles", async () => {
  const { CanvasExtraState } = await import("../../src/display/canvas.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  
  const state = new CanvasExtraState(100, 100);
  const rect = [0, 0, 100, 100];
  const transform = [1, 0.5, 0, 1, 0, 0];
  
  state.minX = Infinity;
  state.minY = Infinity;
  state.maxX = -Infinity;
  state.maxY = -Infinity;
  
  state.updateRectMinMax(transform, rect);
  
  const expectedMinX = 0;
  const expectedMinY = 0;
  const expectedMaxX = 150;
  const expectedMaxY = 100;
  
  expect(state.minX).toBe(expectedMinX);
  expect(state.minY).toBe(expectedMinY);
  expect(state.maxX).toBe(expectedMaxX);
  expect(state.maxY).toBe(expectedMaxY);
});

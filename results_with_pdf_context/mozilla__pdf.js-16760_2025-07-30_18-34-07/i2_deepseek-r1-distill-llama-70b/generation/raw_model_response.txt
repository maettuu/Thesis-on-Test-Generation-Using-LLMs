Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a certain PDF file doesn't render in Firefox 115.0.2 but did in 109.0.1. The problem was caused by a change in how the XRef module parses the PDF, specifically with how it handles "trailer" strings in content streams.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The patch modifies the regular expression in xref.js to avoid matching "trailer" when it's part of a content stream. This prevents false positives when looking for endobj, xref, or trailer sections.

My test needs to check if the PDF renders correctly after the patch. So, the test should attempt to load the PDF and ensure that the document is successfully parsed without throwing an error.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary functions, getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll create a loading task for the problematic PDF.

I expect that before the patch, loading this PDF would throw an InvalidPDFException. After the patch, it should load without errors. So, the test will wait for the document to be loaded and check if it's valid.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll wrap everything in an async function inside the it block. The test will try to get the document and assert that it doesn't throw an error, which would indicate the issue is resolved.

I'll also set a reasonable timeout, maybe 5000 milliseconds, to allow the PDF to load without timing out.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring that it only includes the necessary steps and imports, and nothing else. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the fix.

```javascript
it("should correctly parse a PDF with trailer in content stream", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue16759.pdf'));
  
  await expect(loadingTask).resolves.not.toThrow(InvalidPDFException);
});
```

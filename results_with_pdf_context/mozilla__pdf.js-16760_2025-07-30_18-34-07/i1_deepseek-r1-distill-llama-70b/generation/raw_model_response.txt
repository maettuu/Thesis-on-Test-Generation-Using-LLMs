Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a specific PDF file stopped rendering in Firefox 115.0.2 but worked in earlier versions. The user provided a patch that modifies the xref.js file, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should understand the problem. The PDF is a polyglot file that's valid according to some validators but causes an "Invalid PDF structure" error in the current version of pdf.js. The patch changes a regular expression in xref.js, which suggests it's related to how the XRef entries are parsed.

Looking at the patch, the gEndobjRegExp is modified to include "trailer<<". This means the regex now correctly identifies the end of objects, especially in cases where the trailer is followed by a dictionary.

So, the test should load the problem PDF and check if it can be parsed correctly. Before the patch, this should throw an InvalidPDFException. After the patch, it should load without errors.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary functions: getDocument from api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll attempt to load the PDF and expect it not to throw an exception.

Since the test needs to be self-contained, I'll use async/await and handle any exceptions. I'll also make sure to clean up by destroying the document after loading to avoid memory leaks.

The test will be named "should correctly parse issue16759.pdf" and will use the provided PDF file. I'll wrap the getDocument call in a try-catch block and expect that no exception is thrown.

I should ensure that the test only checks for the specific issue and doesn't introduce any new dependencies or side effects. By focusing on loading the document and checking for exceptions, the test will effectively validate whether the regression is resolved.

```javascript
it("should correctly parse issue16759.pdf", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue16759.pdf'));
  
  await expect(loadingTask).resolves.not.toThrow(InvalidPDFException);
});
```

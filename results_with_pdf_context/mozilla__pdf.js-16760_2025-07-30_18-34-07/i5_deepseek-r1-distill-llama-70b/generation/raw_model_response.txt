Alright, I need to create a regression test for the issue where a specific PDF file doesn't render in Firefox 115.0.2 but did in earlier versions. The user provided a patch that modifies the XRef class, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after it's applied.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The PDF is a polyglot file, which means it's both a valid PDF and an MP3. This can sometimes cause issues with PDF parsers that aren't expecting such structures. The error message indicates an invalid PDF structure, so the test needs to check if the PDF can be loaded without errors.

I'll use the provided imports to structure the test. The test will attempt to load the PDF and check for any errors. If it loads without throwing an error, the test passes.

I'll write a test using Jest's `it` function. I'll import `getDocument` from `api.js` and `buildGetDocumentParams` from `test_utils.js`. Then, I'll set up the PDF file path and attempt to load it.

The key part is ensuring that the test correctly handles both scenarios: before and after the patch. Since the patch is applied in the codebase, the test should pass after the patch. I'll use `await` to handle the asynchronous loading of the PDF.

I'll structure the test to load the document and expect it not to throw an error. If it does throw, the test fails, indicating the issue isn't resolved. If it loads without errors, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. Also, I should handle any potential exceptions during loading to accurately capture the failure.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's concise and directly addresses the issue. The test will only include necessary imports and steps to load the PDF and check for errors.

```javascript
it("should correctly parse the polyglot PDF/MP3 file without throwing an error", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const pdfFile = buildGetDocumentParams('issue16759.pdf');
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(pdfFile);
  
  await expect(loadingTask).resolves.not.toThrow();
});
```

Okay, I need to create a regression test for the given issue. The problem is that a specific PDF file, issue16759.pdf, doesn't render in Firefox 115.0.2 but did in 109.0.1. The error message says it's an invalid PDF structure. The patch modifies the regular expression in xref.js to better handle certain PDF structures.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code had a regex looking for "endobj", "xref", "trailer", etc. The patch adds "trailer << " to the regex. This probably helps in correctly identifying the end of objects, especially in cases where the trailer is followed by a dictionary.

Now, to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should load the problem PDF and check if it can be parsed without errors.

Looking at the test file, I see it's using Jest or similar. I'll need to import necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. I'll also need to handle any errors that occur during loading.

The test should attempt to get the document and check if the root object is a dictionary. If it fails, it should throw an error, which we can catch and handle.

I'll structure the test as an async function. Inside, I'll import the required functions, set up the PDF file path, and then try to get the document. If it throws an error, I'll expect it to be an InvalidPDFException, which would indicate the bug is present. After the patch, this error shouldn't occur.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and the PDF file. I'll also include error handling to catch any exceptions during the document loading.

So, the test will look something like this: attempt to load the PDF, and if it fails with the expected error, the test passes (indicating the bug is present). After the patch, the error shouldn't occur, so the test will pass as the document loads correctly.

I need to make sure the test is concise and only tests the specific issue. I'll use the exact file path and the correct imports to ensure compatibility.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's properly formatted and only returns the JavaScript code as required.

```javascript
it("should render PDF with non-conforming trailer structure", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/issue16759.pdf`;
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams(pdfPath));

  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
    expect(pdfDocument).toBeDefined();
    const root = await pdfDocument.getRoot();
    expect(root).toBeInstanceOf(Object);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("PDF failed to load due to InvalidPDFException");
    }
    throw error;
  }
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a warning appears in the console when printing a PDF with an added annotation. The warning is "Warning: Unknown field name, falling back to empty field name." 

First, I should understand the problem. From the issue description, the warning is triggered when printing a PDF that has annotations. The patch provided modifies the `AnnotationFactory` and `Annotation` classes. The key change is in how `collectFields` is handled. Before the patch, `collectFields` wasn't being passed correctly, leading to the warning.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll write a test that simulates adding an annotation and then printing it, checking that no warning is logged after the patch.

I'll start by looking at the existing test file. It imports necessary modules and has setup functions. I can use `createIdFactory`, `XRefMock`, and `StringStream` from the imports.

I'll create a mock PDF document with an annotation. The annotation should have a subtype that's handled correctly. Maybe a "Highlight" annotation would be a good choice since it's one of the common types.

I'll set up the PDF manager and evaluator to handle the annotation. Then, I'll create the annotation using `AnnotationFactory.create` with `collectFields` set to true because the issue occurs during printing, which involves collecting fields.

Next, I'll simulate the printing process. This might involve rendering the annotation and checking if any warnings are emitted. Since the warning is logged using `warn`, I can override `console.warn` to capture it.

After applying the patch, the warning should no longer appear. So, the test will check that `console.warn` wasn't called during the test run.

I'll structure the test as an `it` block. I'll import necessary modules, set up mocks, create the annotation, and then check for the warning. If no warning is logged, the test passes.

I need to make sure all dependencies are correctly mocked, especially the `acroForm` and `pdfManager`, to avoid any runtime errors during the test.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's concise and only tests the specific behavior related to the warning when printing with annotations.

```javascript
it("should not warn about unknown field names when printing with annotations", async () => {
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const pdfManager = {
    evaluatorOptions: {},
    getAcroForm: () => ({
      get: () => false
    }),
    ensure: (constructor, method, args) => constructor[method](...args)
  };
  const annotationGlobals = {
    pdfManager,
    acroForm: {
      get: () => null
    },
    structTreeRoot: null
  };

  const dict = new Dict();
  dict.set("Subtype", new Name("Highlight"));
  dict.set("T", new Name("title"));
  dict.set("Contents", new Name("content"));

  const consoleWarnSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'warn').mockImplementation(() => {});

  const annotation = await AnnotationFactory.create(xref, new Ref(1), annotationGlobals, idFactory, true);

  expect(consoleWarnSpy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the free highlighting in PDFs lags behind the mouse cursor. The patch provided modifies the outliner.js file, so my test should target that specific behavior.

First, I'll look at the existing test file, annotation_spec.js. It imports several modules, but I might need to add some specific ones for this test. I'll need to import the Outliner and FreeOutliner classes from the editor.

I'll create a test case that simulates adding points to the outliner and checks if the generated outline correctly follows the cursor without lagging. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll set up a mock scenario with a PDF page, perhaps using a simple structure. Then, I'll create an instance of FreeOutliner, add several points to simulate the user drawing, and then generate the outlines.

I'll compare the generated outlines' points to ensure they align with the expected positions, especially focusing on the last points where the lag would occur. If the actual points match the expected, the test passes.

I'll structure the test with async/await, using try-catch to handle any errors and fail the test if something goes wrong.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's self-contained and only uses the necessary imports without adding new dependencies.

```javascript
it("should fix free highlighting lagging behind mouse cursor", async () => {
  const { FreeOutliner } = await import("../../src/display/editor/outliner.js");
  const { DefaultCMapReaderFactory } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  
  const box = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 };
  const scaleFactor = 1;
  const thickness = 2;
  const isLTR = true;
  const innerMargin = 0;
  
  const points = [
    { x: 10, y: 10 },
    { x: 20, y: 20 },
    { x: 30, y: 30 },
    { x: 40, y: 40 },
    { x: 50, y: 50 }
  ];
  
  const outliner = new FreeOutliner(points[0], box, scaleFactor, thickness, isLTR, innerMargin);
  for (const point of points.slice(1)) {
    outliner.add(point);
  }
  
  const outlines = outliner.getOutlines();
  const expectedLastPoint = [points[points.length - 1].x, points[points.length - 1].y];
  
  try {
    // Verify that the last point of the outline matches the expected position
    const actualLastPoint = outlines[outlines.length - 1];
    expect(actualLastPoint).toEqual(expectedLastPoint);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Free highlighting outline does not match expected position");
  }
});

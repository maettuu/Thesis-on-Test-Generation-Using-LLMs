Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a TypeError occurs when parsing a JPEG image. The error happens because 'samplesPerLine' is undefined in the frame object. The patch adds a check to throw an error if the frame is not found, which should prevent the code from proceeding and causing the TypeError.

First, I'll structure the test using the provided example. I'll import JpegImage from the correct path. Then, I'll create a buffer with the given hex data, which is the input that caused the error.

The test should expect that parsing this data with JpegImage.parse() should throw a JpegError with the message "JpegImage.parse - no frame data found." This is because the patch adds this error when the frame is null.

I'll wrap the parse call in a try-catch block. If the correct error is thrown, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails. This ensures that before the patch, the TypeError would occur, but after the patch, the specific JpegError is thrown instead.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the necessary imports. Since the issue is specific to the JpegImage class, I don't need any other imports beyond what's provided.

So, the test will attempt to parse the problematic buffer and check for the expected error message. This will validate that the patch correctly handles the case where the frame data is missing, thus preventing the original TypeError.

```javascript
it("should throw error when frame data is missing", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const buffer = Buffer.from('ffd8', 'hex');
  const expectedError = "JpegImage.parse - no frame data found.";
  
  try {
    await new JpegImage().parse(buffer);
    throw new Error("Expected JpegError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    assert(error instanceof JpegError && error.message === expectedError);
  }
});
```

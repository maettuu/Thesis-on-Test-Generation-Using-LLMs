Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a TypeError occurs when using JpegImage.parse with an incomplete JPEG. The user provided a patch that adds a check for the frame data, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It's test/unit/api_spec.js, which imports various modules. I can reuse the setup here. I notice that it imports from test_utils.js, which has TEST_PDFS_PATH, so I can use that for test files.

I need to create a test that triggers the bug. The issue happens when parsing a JPEG without an EOI marker. So, I'll create a minimal JPEG buffer that starts with 0xffd8 but doesn't have 0xffd9. For example, just 'ffd8' in hex.

In the test, I'll import JpegImage from the correct path. Then, I'll create a buffer using Buffer.from('ffd8', 'hex'). I'll wrap the parse call in a try-catch to check for the error.

Before the patch, the parse method should throw a TypeError because frame.samplesPerLine is undefined. After the patch, it should throw a JpegError with the message about no frame data.

So, the test will mock the data and expect the specific error. I'll use async/await since the parse method is probably asynchronous. 

I'll structure the test with it("should...", async () => {...}). Inside, I'll import JpegImage, create the buffer, and call parse. Then, I'll check if the error is caught and matches the expected message.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files except for the necessary imports. I'll use the provided relative imports and ensure no new dependencies are added.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's concise and directly tests the scenario.

```javascript
it("should handle incomplete JPEG data without throwing TypeError", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const data = Buffer.from("ffd8", "hex");
  const error = new JpegError("JpegImage.parse - no frame data found.");
  
  try {
    await new JpegImage().parse(data);
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof JpegError && e.message === error.message) {
      // Expected error caught
    } else {
      throw e;
    }
  }
});
```

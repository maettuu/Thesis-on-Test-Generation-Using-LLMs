Okay, I need to write a test for the JpegImage.parse method to ensure that the patch resolves the TypeError when 'samplesPerLine' is undefined. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the issue details. The problem occurs when parsing a JPEG image with an incomplete EOI marker. The error happens because the frame object is undefined, leading to 'samplesPerLine' being accessed on undefined.

The patch adds a check for the frame object and throws a JpegError if it's not found. So, the test should simulate this scenario and check that the error is thrown correctly.

I'll use the test.js provided in the issue as a starting point. It imports JpegImage and tries to parse a minimal JPEG buffer. This setup should trigger the error.

In the test, I'll import JpegImage and create a buffer with 'ffd8' which is the SOI marker. Then, I'll call JpegImage.parse with this buffer. Without the patch, this should throw a TypeError. With the patch, it should throw a JpegError.

I need to structure the test using async/await since parse is an async function. I'll use try-catch to handle the exception and assert that the error is caught.

I should also make sure that the test only checks for the specific error and doesn't have any other side effects. Since the test is self-contained, I won't need any additional setup beyond importing JpegImage.

So, the test will import JpegImage, attempt to parse an incomplete JPEG, and expect a JpegError. This will confirm that the patch correctly handles the missing frame case.

```javascript
it("should throw JpegError when frame data is missing", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const buffer = Buffer.from('ffd8', 'hex');
  
  try {
    await JpegImage.parse(buffer);
    assert.fail("Expected JpegError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    assert(error instanceof JpegError);
  }
});
```

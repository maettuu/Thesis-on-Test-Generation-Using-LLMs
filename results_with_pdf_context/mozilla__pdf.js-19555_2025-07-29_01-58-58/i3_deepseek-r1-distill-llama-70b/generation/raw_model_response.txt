Okay, I need to write a test for the regression issue where PDFs using a rare RC4 encryption scheme with R=4, V=4, and a key length less than 128 bits couldn't be opened. The patch provided is supposed to fix this by extending the key to 16 bytes when necessary.

First, I should understand the problem. The PDFs in question use RC4 with R=4 and a shorter key, like 40 or 48 bits. The patch modifies the CipherTransformFactory to check if the algorithm is 4 and the encryption key length is less than 16 bytes. If so, it extends the key with zero bytes to make it 16 bytes.

So, the test needs to verify that before the patch, these PDFs can't be decrypted, and after the patch, they can. But since I'm writing a test that should pass after the patch, I can structure it to expect successful decryption.

I'll use the provided test file and add an 'it' block. I'll import the necessary modules, including getDocument from the display API to load the PDF. The test will attempt to open the problematic PDF and check if it can be read without errors.

I'll need to handle any exceptions that occur during loading, like PasswordException if the decryption fails. If no exception is thrown, that means the PDF was opened successfully, indicating the fix works.

I should also make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's already imported. Using async/await will help manage the asynchronous nature of loading the PDF.

So, the test will try to get the document, and if it succeeds without throwing an exception, the test passes. If it fails, it might indicate the patch isn't applied correctly or there's another issue.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to import the necessary modules and handle any potential errors gracefully.

```javascript
it("should handle RC4 encryption with R=4 and key length <128 bits", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19484_1.pdf'));
  
  let error;
  try {
    const { numPages } = await loadingTask;
    expect(numPages).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }
  
  expect(error).toBeUndefined();
});
```

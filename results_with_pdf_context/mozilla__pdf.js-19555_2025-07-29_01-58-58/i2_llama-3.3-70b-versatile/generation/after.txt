    Expected 'This PDF demonstrates an unusual & under-documented encryption scheme. As of February, 2025(when this file was created), only Acrobat Pro & Reader can open it - of the many PDF viewers, tools, &libraries that I tested.I first observed this encryption scheme in version 1.5 PDFs, purportedly created from "Adobe InDesignCS3 (5.0)" (application) using "Adobe PDF Library 8.0" (producer).The unusual aspect is that while the encryption dictionary specifies R=4 and V=4, the key length is 40 bits(5 bytes). Commonly, V=4 is thought to require a 128-bit key, but it appears that Acrobat allows a shorterkey and pads it to 128 bits before use - a behavior I cannot find described in existing PDF specifications.Technical details:User password: "" (empty / default)Owner password: "ownerpass"Metadata encrypted: falseKey: 0x0446615747The 5-byte key is first used for user and owner password verification as described in the specification.However, before performing "Algorithm 1: Encryption of data usin ... to contain 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.'.

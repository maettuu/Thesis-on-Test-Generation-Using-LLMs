Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should support RC encryption with R and key length bits", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams("issue19484_1.pdf"));
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const numPages = pdfDocument.numPages;
  expect(numPages).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/crypto_spec.js` file before running it.

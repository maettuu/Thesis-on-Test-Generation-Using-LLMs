Alright, I need to write a regression test for the given patch. The patch modifies how transformations are applied in the font rendering and operator list. The issue was a bug where certain PDFs with specific fonts weren't rendering correctly after the transformations were applied.

First, I'll focus on the font_renderer.js and operator_list.js changes. The patch updates the applyTransform and applyTransformToBezier functions to accept a position parameter, allowing them to modify specific parts of an array. This should fix issues where only parts of the path were transformed, leading to incorrect rendering.

To test this, I'll create a test that checks if the transformation correctly modifies the expected points in a path. I'll generate a sample path, apply a transformation, and check if the points match the expected transformed values.

I'll import the Util class from the shared/util.js file since it contains the applyTransform method. Then, I'll define a sample path and a transformation matrix. After applying the transformation, I'll compare each point in the transformed path with the expected values.

This test should fail before the patch because the transformation wouldn't correctly apply to all points, and pass after the patch since the logic is fixed.

```javascript
it("should correctly apply affine transforms to path data", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const path = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80];
  const expected = [20, 50, 90, 140, 110, 130, 150, 160];
  const transform = [2, 0, 0, 2, 10, 20];
  
  Util.applyTransform(path, transform, 0);
  Util.applyTransform(path, transform, 2);
  Util.applyTransform(path, transform, 4);
  Util.applyTransform(path, transform, 6);

  expect(path[0]).toBe(expected[0]);
  expect(path[1]).toBe(expected[1]);
  expect(path[2]).toBe(expected[2]);
  expect(path[3]).toBe(expected[3]);
  expect(path[4]).toBe(expected[4]);
  expect(path[5]).toBe(expected[5]);
  expect(path[6]).toBe(expected[6]);
  expect(path[7]).toBe(expected[7]);
});
```

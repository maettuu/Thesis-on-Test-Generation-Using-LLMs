Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the patch that was applied. Let me first understand what the patch does.

Looking at the patch, I see that it's modifying several files: font_renderer.js, operator_list.js, and util.js. The main changes are in the applyTransform and applyTransformToBezier functions. They added a 'pos' parameter and modified how the transformation is applied to the points.

In font_renderer.js, the add method used to directly access the currentTransform and apply it to each pair of args. Now, it uses Util.applyTransform with the currentTransform and the current index. So, the transformation is applied in a way that starts at the correct position in the array.

In operator_list.js, the code used to call Util.applyTransform with a subarray. Now, it passes the buffer and the current index k, which means the transformation is applied in-place without creating a new subarray. The same goes for applyTransformToBezier.

In util.js, the applyTransform function now accepts an optional 'pos' parameter, which allows it to start applying the transformation at a specific position in the array. Similarly, applyTransformToBezier now takes 'pos' and applies the transformation to each pair starting from that position.

So, the key change is that the transformation functions no longer take subarrays but instead modify the original array starting at a specified position. This should fix issues where the transformation was incorrectly applied to the wrong parts of the array, especially in cases where multiple transformations are applied sequentially.

Now, to write a regression test. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. I need to create a scenario where the old code would produce incorrect results, and the new code corrects it.

I'll create a test that applies multiple transformations to a set of points. The old code would mishandle the indices, while the new code should correctly apply each transformation starting at the right position.

I'll define an array of points and apply two transformations. Then, I'll compare the resulting points against the expected values. Before the patch, the result would be wrong, but after, it should match.

In the test, I'll initialize the points, apply the first transformation starting at position 0, then the second starting at position 2. I'll check if the transformed points match the expected values.

So, the test will import the Util class and use the applyTransform function. It will set up the points, apply the transformations step by step, and assert that the final points are as expected.

This should ensure that the patch correctly handles multiple transformations applied at different positions in the array.

it("should correctly apply multiple transformations at different positions", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const points = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const expected = [5, 6, 7, 8];
  const transform1 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1];
  const transform2 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2];
  
  // Apply first transform starting at position 0
  Util.applyTransform(points, transform1, 0);
  // Apply second transform starting at position 2
  Util.applyTransform(points, transform2, 2);
  
  assert.deepEqual(points, expected);
});

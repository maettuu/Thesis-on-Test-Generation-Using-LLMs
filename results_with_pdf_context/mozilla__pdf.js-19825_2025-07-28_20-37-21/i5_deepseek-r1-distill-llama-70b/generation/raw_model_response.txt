Alright, I need to write a regression test for the patch provided. The patch modifies several files related to font rendering and transform application. The issue mentioned is a regression on Linux, OSX, and Windows, so the test should be platform-agnostic.

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main changes are in `font_renderer.js`, `operator_list.js`, and `util.js`. The `applyTransform` and `applyTransformToBezier` functions have been updated to accept a position parameter, which allows them to modify specific parts of the array without subarraying. This should improve performance and correctness by avoiding unnecessary copying.

The test should check if these functions correctly apply transformations. I'll create a test case where a transformation matrix is applied to a set of points using both the original and updated functions. The original functions might incorrectly modify the points or not handle the position correctly, leading to failures.

I'll define an identity matrix to start with, ensuring no change. Then, a sample point (100, 100) is used. After applying the transformation, the result should remain the same. Next, a scaling matrix (2,0,0,2,0,0) is applied. The expected result is (200, 200). I'll test both the `applyTransform` and `applyTransformToBezier` functions.

For `applyTransform`, I'll create a buffer array with the point and apply the transform. For `applyTransformToBezier`, I'll simulate a Bezier curve with control points and ensure all relevant points are transformed correctly.

I'll structure the test using Jest, importing `Util` from the correct path. The test will have two parts: one for `applyTransform` and another for `applyTransformToBezier`. Each part will compare the expected and actual results using `expect` statements.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained, so I'll define all necessary variables and transformations within the test block. This way, the test doesn't rely on external state and can run independently.

Finally, I'll write the test in JavaScript, making sure to use async/await for imports and structure the code as per the example provided. The test should clearly fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the regression is resolved.

```javascript
it("should correctly apply transform to points after regression fix", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  
  // Define a sample identity matrix
  const identityMatrix = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0];
  
  // Test applyTransform with position parameter
  {
    const point = [100, 100];
    const expected = [100, 100];
    const actual = [...point];
    Util.applyTransform(actual, identityMatrix, 0);
    expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
  }

  // Test applyTransform with scale matrix
  {
    const scaleMatrix = [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0];
    const point = [100, 100];
    const expected = [200, 200];
    const actual = [...point];
    Util.applyTransform(actual, scaleMatrix, 0);
    expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
  }

  // Test applyTransformToBezier with position parameter
  {
    const bezier = [0, 0, 50, 150, 100, 100, 200, 200];
    const expected = [0, 0, 100, 300, 200, 200, 400, 400];
    const actual = [...bezier];
    const matrix = [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0];
    Util.applyTransformToBezier(actual, matrix, 0);
    expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
  }
});

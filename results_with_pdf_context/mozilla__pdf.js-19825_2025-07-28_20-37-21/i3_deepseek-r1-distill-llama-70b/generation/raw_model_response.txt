Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue described. The issue is related to a bug in the pdfpaint module, specifically bug1245391_reduced.pdf and others. The patch provided modifies several files, including font_renderer.js, operator_list.js, and util.js. 

Looking at the changes, the main modifications are in the applyTransform functions in util.js. The patch updates these functions to accept an additional parameter, pos, which allows applying the transformation starting at a specific position in the array. This suggests that before the patch, the functions didn't handle the position correctly, leading to incorrect transformations.

My task is to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check the correctness of the applyTransform function.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since the test is in unit/util_spec.js, I can reuse the existing imports but might need to import Util from the shared/util.js.

I'll create a test case where I define a point and a transformation matrix. Before the patch, applying the transformation without the pos parameter might not work as expected, especially when the array has multiple points. After the patch, using the pos parameter correctly should fix the issue.

I'll set up an example where the array has two points, and the transformation is applied starting at the second point. I'll check if the transformation correctly modifies the second point without affecting the first.

In the test, I'll define the expected values after transformation. Then, I'll apply the transformation using the patched Util.applyTransform function with the pos parameter. Finally, I'll compare the actual result with the expected values using assert.deepEqual.

This test should fail before the patch because the function didn't handle the pos correctly, but after applying the patch, it should pass, indicating the bug is fixed.

```javascript
it("should correctly apply affine transformations with position parameter", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const point = [5, 7];
  const transform = [2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4];
  const expected = [5*2 + 7*0 + 3, 5*0 + 7*2 + 4];
  const actual = [...point];
  Util.applyTransform(actual, transform, 0);
  assert.deepEqual(actual, expected);
});
```

Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should apply transform correctly with position offset", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  const point = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const transform = [1, 0, 0, 1, 5, 6];
  const pos = 2;
  const expected = [1, 2, 8, 10];
  Util.applyTransform(point, transform, pos);
  expect(point).toEqual(expected);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/util_spec.js` file before running it.

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that fixes bug 1245391. The patch modifies several files to avoid creating subarrays when applying transformations, which improves performance. My test should fail before the patch and pass after it's applied.

First, I'll look at the changes made. The patch replaces subarray calls with direct array accesses. For example, in operator_list.js, they changed buffer.subarray(k) to buffer with an offset. Similarly, in util.js, the applyTransform and applyTransformToBezier functions now accept a position parameter to modify the array in place.

The test should measure the performance impact. I'll create a large array of points and apply transformations to it. I'll use the Util.applyTransform method repeatedly to simulate the workload.

I'll set up a test that times how long it takes to process these points. Before the patch, this should be slower because of the subarray creations. After the patch, the time should decrease significantly.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, create a large array, and measure the time before and after the patch. The test will check if the time after the patch is less than before, indicating the fix works.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import the required modules to ensure compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test to compare the execution times, ensuring it fails without the patch and passes with it. This will confirm that the performance regression is resolved.

```javascript
it("should improve performance when applying multiple transforms", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  const { OperatorList } = await import("../../core/operator_list.js");
  
  // Create a large array of points to transform
  const points = new Float64Array(1000000);
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i += 2) {
    points[i] = Math.random();
    points[i + 1] = Math.random();
  }
  
  // Create a sample transform matrix
  const transform = [0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 10, 20];
  
  // Measure time before optimization
  const beforeTime = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i += 2) {
    Util.applyTransform(points, transform, i);
  }
  const afterTime = performance.now();
  
  // Verify the optimization reduces execution time
  const executionTime = afterTime - beforeTime;
  expect(executionTime).toBeLessThan(100);
});
```

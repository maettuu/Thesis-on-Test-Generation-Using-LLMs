Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where read-only form fields aren't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The patch provided modifies the isRenderable condition in TextWidgetAnnotationElement, so my test should check if the field is correctly rendered after the patch.

First, I'll set up the test using the provided PDF file. I'll import getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll create a loading task for the PDF.

Next, I need to set the AnnotationMode to 1. I'll create a mock of the PDFDocument so I can override the annotationMode property. This way, when the PDF is loaded, it uses the desired mode.

I'll load the first page of the PDF and check if the text layer is rendered. I'll look for the text widget element and verify its visibility.

I'll also check the text layer for the expected text content. If the element is rendered and the text is present, the test passes.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. I'll structure the test with async/await for proper execution.

Finally, I'll write the test in JavaScript, ensuring it's concise and directly tests the issue at hand.

```javascript
it("should render readonly text widget annotations when forms are disabled", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17064_readonly.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDoc = new (class {
    get annotationMode() {
      return 1; // AnnotationMode.ENABLED
    }
  });
  
  const page = await loadingTask.promise.then(function({ numPages, getPage }) {
    return getPage(1);
  });
  
  const textLayer = await page.getTextContent();
  const textWidgetElements = textLayer.items.filter(item => item.str === "Foo");
  
  expect(textWidgetElements.length).toBe(1);
});
```

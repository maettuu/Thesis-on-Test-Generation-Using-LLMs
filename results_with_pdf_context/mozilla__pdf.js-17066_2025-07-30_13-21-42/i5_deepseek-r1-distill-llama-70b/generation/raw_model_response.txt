Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a read-only form field isn't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to 1. The patch provided modifies the isRenderable condition in TextWidgetAnnotationElement. 

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. When AnnotationMode is ENABLED (1), the text field isn't shown, but it should be. The patch adds a condition to check if the form has its own canvas, which might fix this.

So, the test should check if the text field is rendered correctly after the patch. I'll need to load the specific PDF and set the AnnotationMode to 1. Then, I'll look for the text field in the DOM.

I'll use the getDocument function from the API and the test utility to get the PDF. Once the PDF is loaded, I'll get the first page and render it. Then, I'll check the DOM elements to see if the text field exists and isn't hidden.

I should make sure that the test fails before the patch and passes after. So, the test will look for the presence of the text field element and its visibility.

I'll structure the test using Jest, importing necessary modules, setting up the page, and asserting the expected behavior.

```javascript
it("should render read-only text fields when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17064_readonly.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const annotationMode = 1; // ENABLED

  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });

  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.style.width = `${viewport.width}px`;
  div.style.height = `${viewport.height}px`;
  document.body.appendChild(div);

  const renderTask = page.render({
    container: div,
    viewport: viewport,
    annotationMode: annotationMode,
  });

  await renderTask.promise;

  const widgetElements = div.querySelectorAll('.textWidget');
  expect(widgetElements.length).toBe(1);
  const widget = widgetElements[0];
  expect(widget.hidden).toBe(false);
});
```

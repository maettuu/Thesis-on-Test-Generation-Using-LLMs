Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a read-only form field isn't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the problem. The user mentioned that when AnnotationMode is 1, the read-only text field doesn't show up. The patch modifies the isRenderable condition in TextWidgetAnnotationElement. So, the test should check if the element is rendered correctly after the patch.

I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll need to import the necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. Then, I'll load the specific PDF file provided, issue17064_readonly.pdf.

Next, I'll set the AnnotationMode to 1 using the second parameter of getDocument. This will ensure the test runs in the correct mode.

After loading the PDF, I'll get the first page and render it. I'll create a text layer to check for the presence of the form field.

The key part is to check if the text widget annotation element is rendered. I'll look for elements with the class 'textWidgetAnnotation' in the DOM. If the element exists and has the correct text, the test passes.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function. I'll make sure all imports are dynamic to work with Node.js. The test will load the PDF, render the page, and then check for the presence of the form field.

I also need to handle any potential errors, like the PDF failing to load or the element not being found. Wrapping everything in a promise and using async/await will help manage the flow.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's self-contained and only tests the specific behavior. This way, when the patch is applied, the test will pass, confirming the fix.

```javascript
it("should render read-only text form field when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17064_readonly.pdf'));
  
  const pdf = await loadingTask;
  const annotationMode = AnnotationMode.ENABLED;
  const pdfDoc = await pdf.getDocument({ annotationMode });
  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
  const textLayer = page.createTextLayer({ viewport, onRender: () => {} });

  const textWidgetElements = document.getElementsByClassName('textWidgetAnnotation');
  const textWidgetElement = textWidgetElements[0];
  
  expect(textWidgetElement).toBeTruthy();
  expect(textWidgetElement.textContent).toBe('Foo');
});
```

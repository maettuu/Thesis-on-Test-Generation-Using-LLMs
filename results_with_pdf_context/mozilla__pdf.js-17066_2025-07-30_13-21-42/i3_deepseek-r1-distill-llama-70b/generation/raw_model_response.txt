Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the read-only form field is rendered correctly when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The problem was that before the patch, the field wasn't rendered in this mode, but it should be after the patch.

First, I'll look at the existing test file provided. It imports necessary modules, but I might need to add more, like the AnnotationLayer and other dependencies for rendering.

I'll start by setting up the test. I'll need to get the PDF document using getDocument. The PDF file is 'issue17064_readonly.pdf', so I'll use buildGetDocumentParams to create the loading task.

Next, I'll set the AnnotationMode to 1 (ENABLED). I'll create a div element to simulate the DOM for rendering the annotations.

I'll then get the first page of the document and create an AnnotationLayer instance. I'll set renderForms to true because the default is ENABLED_FORMS (2), but we need to test with ENABLED (1).

After rendering the layer, I'll check if the text widget annotation element is rendered. I'll look for elements with the class 'textWidgetAnnotation' and ensure their text content is not empty.

I'll use Jest's expect statements to verify that the elements exist and that the text is displayed correctly. This should confirm that the patch fixes the issue where the read-only field wasn't showing up before.

I also need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll structure the test to import necessary modules dynamically to maintain compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's concise and directly addresses the issue. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the problem is resolved.

```javascript
it("should render read-only form field when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17064_readonly.pdf'));

  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewPort({ scale: 1 });
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  
  const annotationLayer = new (await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js")).AnnotationLayer({
    div,
    page,
    viewport,
    l10n: new (await import("../../web/genericl10n.js")).NullL10n(),
    annotationCanvasMap: new Map(),
    accessibilityManager: null,
  });

  const renderForms = true;
  await annotationLayer.render({
    annotations: await page.getAnnotations(),
    renderForms,
    enableScripting: true,
    hasJSActions: false,
    parent: {
      page,
      viewport,
      zIndex: 0,
    },
  });

  const textWidgetElements = div.getElementsByClassName('textWidgetAnnotation');
  const textContent = textWidgetElements[0].textContent;

  expect(textWidgetElements.length).toBe(1);
  expect(textContent).toBe("Foo");
});
```

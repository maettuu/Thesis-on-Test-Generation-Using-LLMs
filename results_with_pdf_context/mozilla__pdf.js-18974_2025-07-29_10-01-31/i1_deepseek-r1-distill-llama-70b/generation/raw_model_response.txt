Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF isn't rendering correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor in decode_stream.js. My task is to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the patch. The change in the constructor adds a line that filters the streams array to include only instances of BaseStream. This suggests that before the patch, non-BaseStream objects might have been causing issues.

So, the test should create a situation where a StreamsSequenceStream is constructed with a mix of valid and invalid streams. Then, it should check if the stream initializes correctly, especially the maybeLength calculation.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in test/unit/stream_spec.js, I can use the existing imports and maybe add any new ones if needed. I'll need to import Dict from primitives.js and Stream from stream.js, which are already there. I might also need to import DecodeStream or BaseStream, but looking at the code, DecodeStream extends BaseStream, so perhaps it's sufficient.

Next, I'll set up the test case. I'll create an array of streams, including both DecodeStream instances and other objects. For example, I can create a few DecodeStream instances and add a non-BaseStream object, like a simple object with a length property.

In the test, I'll construct a StreamsSequenceStream with this array. Before the patch, this might have caused an error or incorrect maybeLength because it includes non-BaseStream objects. After the patch, the filter should remove the invalid streams, and the maybeLength should be calculated correctly based only on the valid ones.

I'll write the test using Jest syntax. I'll initialize the streams array, create the StreamsSequenceStream, and then check if the maybeLength is as expected. Since the test is async, I'll wrap it in an async function.

Wait, but the StreamsSequenceStream's constructor doesn't return a promise. So, I don't need to await it. I can directly create the instance and check the properties.

I should also handle any potential errors. Maybe the test should expect that no error is thrown during construction. Alternatively, I can check that the streams array is properly filtered.

Putting it all together, the test will create a StreamsSequenceStream with a mixed array, then check that the maybeLength is the sum of the lengths of the DecodeStream instances. This ensures that the filter is working as intended.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to only include the necessary imports and keep the test focused on verifying the patch's correctness.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle StreamsSequenceStream with mixed stream types", async () => {
  const streams = [
    new DecodeStream(),
    new DecodeStream(),
    { length: 10 }
  ];
  const streamsSequenceStream = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);
  expect(streamsSequenceStream._rawMinBufferLength).toBe(0);
});
```

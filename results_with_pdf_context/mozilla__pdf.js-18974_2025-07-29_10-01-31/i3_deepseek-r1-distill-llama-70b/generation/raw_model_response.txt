Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor in decode_stream.js. My task is to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I'll look at the patch. It adds a line that filters the streams to include only those that are instances of BaseStream. This suggests that before the patch, non-BaseStream instances were causing issues when constructing StreamsSequenceStream.

So, the test should simulate a scenario where a stream that's not a BaseStream is passed. Without the patch, this should cause an error, and with the patch, it should handle it gracefully.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import necessary modules like Dict, Stream, and PredictorStream. Then, I'll create a test case where I pass a non-BaseStream object to StreamsSequenceStream.

In the test, I'll create a StreamsSequenceStream with a stream that's not a BaseStream. Before the patch, this should throw an error because the constructor didn't filter streams. After the patch, it should not throw because it ignores non-BaseStream instances.

I'll use async/await for any asynchronous operations, like getting the document. I'll also need to load the specific PDF file provided, which is 'issue18973.pdf'.

I'll write the test to check if the streams are correctly filtered. If the test doesn't throw an error after the patch, it means the issue is resolved.

So, the test will create a StreamsSequenceStream with a non-BaseStream, and expect it not to throw an error, indicating the patch works.

```javascript
it("should handle non-BaseStream instances in StreamsSequenceStream", async () => {
  const { Dict } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");
  const { PredictorStream } = await import("../../src/core/predictor_stream.js");
  const { Stream } = await import("../../src/core/stream.js");
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  // Create a test stream that is not a BaseStream
  class TestStream extends Stream {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.dict = new Dict();
    }
  }

  // Create a StreamsSequenceStream with a mix of valid and invalid streams
  const streams = [new TestStream(), new PredictorStream(new Stream(new Uint8Array(0)))];
  const sss = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);

  // Without the patch, this would throw an error
  // With the patch, it should handle the invalid stream gracefully
  await expect(sss.readBlock()).resolves.not.toThrow();
});

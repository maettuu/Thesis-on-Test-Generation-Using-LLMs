Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor, filtering out streams that aren't instances of BaseStream. 

First, I should understand the issue. The problem occurs when loading a specific PDF and navigating to page 45. The expected behavior is that the page displays correctly, but an error occurs instead. The test should fail before the patch and pass after applying it.

I'll start by setting up the test structure using Jest. The test will be an async function inside an it block. I'll need to import the necessary modules: getDocument from the API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js.

Next, I'll load the PDF using getDocument with the correct parameters. I'll use the PDF file named 'issue18973.pdf' from the test_utils. 

I'll create a try-catch block to handle any errors during loading. If the PDF loads without errors, I'll proceed to page 45. I'll use page.render() to render the page and check for any errors during rendering. 

The test should assert that no error occurs during these steps. If an error is caught, the test will fail, indicating the bug is still present. After applying the patch, the test should pass, meaning the bug is fixed.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. I'll structure the test to load the PDF, navigate to the problem page, and check for successful rendering without errors.

Finally, I'll write the JavaScript code, ensuring it's concise and only includes the necessary steps to verify the bug fix.

```javascript
it("should render page 45 of issue18973.pdf without errors", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18973.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
    const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(45);
    const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
    
    // Render the page to check for any errors
    const renderResult = await page.render({
      viewport,
      canvasContext: null, // Using null to avoid actual rendering
      continueRendering: () => true,
    });
    
    expect(renderResult).not.toThrow();
  } catch (error) {
    fail('Error rendering page 45: ' + error.message);
  }
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF file causes a "TypeError: e.peekBytes is not a function" error. The user provided a patch that modifies the evaluator.js file, and I need to ensure the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The error occurs because the code expects a Stream but gets a Dict instead. The patch adds checks to handle this case by throwing an error and using a NullStream, which should prevent the TypeError.

The test should load the provided PDF and check if the text is rendered correctly. Before the patch, the test should fail because the text isn't visible. After the patch, it should pass as the text becomes visible.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules: getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll load the PDF and check if text is extracted correctly.

I'll set up the test to load the document, get the first page, and extract the text. If the text is empty before the patch, the test will fail. After the patch, the text should be non-empty, making the test pass.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. Also, I'll handle any potential errors during loading or rendering.

So, the test will look like this: load the PDF, render the page, extract text, and assert that the text is not empty. This will confirm that the patch resolves the issue.

```javascript
it("should handle PDFs with invalid FontFile entries", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18941.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
    const pageIndex = 0;
    const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(pageIndex);
    const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
    const text = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join("");
    
    expect(text).not.toBe("");
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeUndefined();
  }
});
```

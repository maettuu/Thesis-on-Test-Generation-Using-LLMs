Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should render text from a PDF with a nonstream FontFile entry", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18941.pdf'));
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  const expectedText = "FAMI INVERSION SAS"; // Example expected text
  const actualText = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join(" ");
  expect(actualText).toContain(expectedText);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/evaluator_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

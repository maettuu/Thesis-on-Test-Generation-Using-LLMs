Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the PDF.js library is throwing a TypeError because e.peekBytes is not a function. The user provided a patch, and I need to ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I'll look at the problem. The error occurs when loading a specific PDF file. The function getFontFileType is expecting 'e' to be a Stream, but it's a Dict instead. The patch modifies the evaluator.js file to handle cases where fontFile might not be a Stream.

So, the test should load the provided PDF and check if it renders without errors. Before the patch, it should throw an error, and after, it should load correctly.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll create a loading task for the PDF.

Since the error is in the console, I'll need to check for any errors during loading. I'll use a try-catch block. If an error occurs, the test should fail. After the patch, the PDF should load without errors.

I'll set a timeout to allow the PDF to load. If it doesn't throw an error within that time, the test passes.

So, the test will attempt to load the PDF and fail if any error is caught, indicating the issue still exists. After applying the patch, the test should pass as the error is resolved.

```javascript
it("should load PDF without font translation errors", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18941.pdf'));
  
  try {
    await loadingTask.promise;
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeUndefined();
  }
});
```

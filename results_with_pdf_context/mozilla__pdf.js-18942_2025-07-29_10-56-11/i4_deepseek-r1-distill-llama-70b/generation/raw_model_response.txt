Okay, I need to create a test that verifies the patch fixes the issue where the PDF doesn't render text correctly. The user provided a PDF file, issue18941.pdf, which triggers the bug. 

First, I should understand the problem. The bug occurs because the code expects a Stream but receives a Dict, causing a TypeError. The patch modifies the evaluator.js file to handle this case properly.

So, the test should check if the text is rendered correctly after applying the patch. 

I'll use the getDocument function from the display API to load the PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and render it, checking if the text is present.

I'll write a test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically to ensure compatibility. The test will attempt to load the PDF and check for the presence of the expected text.

I'll structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle any errors during loading or rendering. If the text isn't found, the test will fail, indicating the bug isn't fixed.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external state. It should clearly pass when the patch is applied and fail otherwise.

```javascript
it("should render text in issue18941.pdf correctly", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue18941.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdf = await loadingTask;
    const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
    const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
    
    expect(textContent.items.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(textContent.items[0].str.join('')).toContain('INVERSION');
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Failed to load or render PDF:', error);
  }
});
```

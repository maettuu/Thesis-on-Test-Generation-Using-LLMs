Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where the redo shortcut isn't working for images, text, or drawings in the PDF editor. The patch provided modifies the key combinations for the redo command in the tools.js file. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds more key combinations for redo, specifically handling cases where on Mac, the event.key might be "Z" or "z" when using meta+shift+z. So the redo command now listens to more key combinations than before.

To write a test that fails before the patch and passes after, I need to simulate adding an annotation, undoing it, and then trying to redo it using the affected shortcuts. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I'll need the AnnotationEditorUIManager and CommandManager from tools.js, and maybe some test utilities.

I'll create an annotation editor UI manager instance. Then, I'll add an annotation, like a text annotation. After adding, I'll trigger an undo command, which should remove the annotation. Then, I'll simulate pressing the redo shortcut, specifically the ones that were added in the patch, like "ctrl+shift+Z" or "mac+meta+shift+Z".

I'll need to check if the annotation is correctly redone after the shortcut is pressed. So, I'll count the annotations before and after the redo command to see if it increases back to 1.

In the test, I'll structure it with Jest's it block. I'll use async/await for any promises, like when creating the UI manager or adding annotations.

I should also make sure that the test doesn't rely on any UI elements beyond what's necessary, keeping it focused on the functionality.

So, putting it all together, the test will:

1. Import the required modules.
2. Initialize the UI manager.
3. Add an annotation.
4. Undo the action.
5. Simulate the redo shortcut.
6. Check that the annotation count returns to 1, indicating the redo worked.

This should cover the scenario where the redo shortcut was previously not working but now functions correctly after the patch.

```javascript
it("should redo an annotation using ctrl+shift+Z", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, CommandManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager();
  const commandManager = new CommandManager();
  
  // Add an annotation
  uiManager.addAnnotation("text", { x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 20 });
  
  // Undo the annotation
  commandManager.execute("undo");
  
  // Redo using the new shortcut
  commandManager.execute("redo");
  
  // Verify the annotation was added back
  expect(uiManager.getAnnotations().length).toBe(1);
});
```

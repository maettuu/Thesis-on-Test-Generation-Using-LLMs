Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the redo shortcut wasn't working for images, text, or drawings in the PDF editor. The patch fixed this by updating the keyboard shortcuts in the tools.js file. 

First, I should understand what the patch did. It looks like the redo shortcuts were expanded to include more key combinations, especially for macOS. So, the test needs to verify that redo works correctly after an undo, using these new shortcuts.

I'll start by looking at the existing test file, annotation_spec.js. It imports several modules, but I might need to import the necessary classes from the editor tools. I'll need to import AnnotationEditorUIManager, CommandManager, and maybe some others.

I'll set up a test case where I add an annotation, undo it, and then redo it using the new shortcuts. Since the test is in JavaScript, I'll simulate the keyboard events.

I'll create a mock setup: maybe a PDF document with a page, an annotation editor layer, and the UI manager. Then, I'll add an editor, commit it, undo, and then send a redo keyboard event.

I need to check if the editor is properly redone after the event. So, I'll compare the state before and after the redo command.

I should make sure the test doesn't rely on the UI but uses the internal state of the CommandManager. Maybe I can check if the command manager's position or the editor's presence indicates a successful redo.

I'll structure the test: setup the dependencies, create the UI manager, add an editor, commit, undo, then trigger the redo event, and assert that the editor is back.

I also need to handle any asynchronous operations, like adding editors or committing changes, so I'll use async/await where necessary.

Finally, I'll write the test as an it block, ensuring it's self-contained and uses only the provided imports.

```javascript
it("should redo an annotation using keyboard shortcuts", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, CommandManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { AnnotationFactory, MarkupAnnotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  
  // Setup mock objects
  const mockLayer = {
    addOrRebuild: jest.fn(),
    deserialize: jest.fn(),
  };
  
  const mockEditor = {
    commit: jest.fn(),
    isEmpty: jest.fn(() => false),
    id: "test-editor",
    pageIndex: 0,
  };
  
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager({
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
  }, {
    _on: jest.fn(),
    _off: jest.fn(),
  }, {
    annotationStorage: {
      has: jest.fn(),
      setValue: jest.fn(),
      remove: jest.fn(),
    }
  }, {});

  uiManager.currentLayer = mockLayer;
  uiManager.addEditor(mockEditor);
  
  // Add initial command
  uiManager.addCommands({
    cmd: () => {},
    undo: () => {},
  });

  // Test undo first
  uiManager.undo();
  expect(uiManager.commandManager.position).toBe(0);

  // Simulate redo keyboard event
  const event = {
    key: "Z",
    ctrlKey: true,
    shiftKey: true,
    metaKey: true,
  };
  
  uiManager.keydown(event);
  
  // Verify redo was executed
  expect(uiManager.commandManager.position).toBe(1);
});
```

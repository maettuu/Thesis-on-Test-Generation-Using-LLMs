Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the redo shortcut wasn't working on macOS. The patch updated the keyboard shortcuts in tools.js to include more cases for redo, especially handling the "meta+shift+z" and "meta+shift+Z" combinations. 

First, I should figure out how the test will verify that the redo action is triggered correctly with these shortcuts. Since the problem is specific to macOS, the test should simulate a macOS environment. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I'll need the AnnotationEditorUIManager from tools.js and the KeyboardManager from keyboard.js. 

Next, I'll set up a mock container and eventBus to create an instance of AnnotationEditorUIManager. This will allow me to test the keyboard shortcuts within this manager.

I'll create a test editor and add it to the manager. Then, I'll simulate an undo action to have something to redo. 

The key part is simulating the keyboard events. I'll create a function to dispatch keyboard events with specific key combinations. For the "meta+shift+z" case, I'll set the key to "Z" and the modifiers to include meta and shift. Similarly, I'll test the "meta+shift+Z" case, but since the key is already "Z", I'll ensure the modifiers are correct.

After each event, I'll check if the redo method was called. I'll use a spy or mock function on the redo method to track if it's invoked as expected.

I should also ensure that the test doesn't rely on any UI elements and works in a headless environment, as it's a unit test.

Putting it all together, the test will initialize the manager, perform an undo, and then test both redo shortcuts to confirm they work on macOS. This should cover the cases that were previously broken and now fixed by the patch.

  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");

  const container = {
    addEventListener: () => {},
    removeEventListener: () => {}

  const pageColors = {};
  
  const manager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(container, eventBus, pdfDocument, pageColors);
  
  const editor = {
    type: "text",
    id: "test-editor",
    redo: () => {}
  };
  
  manager.addEditor(editor);
  
  // Mock the redo method
  const redoSpy = jest.spyOn(editor, 'redo');
  
  // Simulate an undo first
  manager.undo();
  
  // Test meta+shift+z
  const event = {
    key: 'z',
    code: 'MetaLeft',
    ctrlKey: false,
    metaKey: true,
    shiftKey: true,
    preventDefault: () => {}

  manager._handleKeyboardEvent(event);
  
  expect(redoSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  
  redoSpy.mockClear();
  
  // Test meta+shift+Z
  const event2 = {
    key: 'Z',
    code: 'MetaLeft',
    ctrlKey: false,
    metaKey: true,
    shiftKey: true,

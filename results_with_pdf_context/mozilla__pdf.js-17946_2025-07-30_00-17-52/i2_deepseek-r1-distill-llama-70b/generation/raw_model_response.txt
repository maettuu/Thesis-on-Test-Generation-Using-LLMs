Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the patch fixes the issue where large images in PDFs aren't rendered by PDF.js. The user provided a PDF file named issue17289.pdf. 

First, I should understand the problem. The user mentioned that when opening the PDF, the scanned book page image doesn't render. The console logs show warnings about unsupported JPX options and dependent images not being ready. The patch replaces the existing JPX decoder with OpenJPEG, which should handle these cases better.

So, the test needs to check if the image is correctly rendered after applying the patch. 

I'll use the provided imports to get the PDF document. I'll need to import getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. 

The test should load the PDF, get the first page, and check if any errors occur during rendering. If the patch works, no errors should be thrown, and the page should render without issues.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function. Inside the async function, I'll load the PDF, fetch the first page, and then the first operator list. I'll wrap the rendering in a promise to catch any errors. If no errors occur, the test passes.

I should ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. 

So, putting it all together, the test will import the necessary modules, load the PDF, and check for successful rendering of the page without errors.

```javascript
it("should render large JPX images correctly", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17289.pdf'));

  const pdf = await loadingTask;
  const firstPage = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const operators = await firstPage.getOperatorList();

  // We need to wait for any pending rendering tasks
  await operators.run((op) => {
    if (op.type === 'drawImage') {
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        resolve();
      });
    }
  });

  // If no errors were thrown, the test passes
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

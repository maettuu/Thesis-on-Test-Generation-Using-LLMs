Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the font size slider in the text editor isn't working smoothly. The patch provided modifies the moveInDOM method to debounce it, which should fix the problem. 

First, I'll think about what the test should do. The test should simulate changing the font size and check if the editor's position updates correctly without blocking the UI. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I need the AnnotationEditor from the editor.js file and some utilities for creating test documents and handling events.

Next, I'll set up a test document and editor. I'll create a fake editor with initial dimensions and position it on the page. 

Then, I'll simulate the user changing the font size. This should trigger the editor to adjust its size and reposition itself. 

The key part is checking the moveInDOM method. Before the patch, this method was called immediately, which could cause performance issues. After the patch, it should be debounced. So, I'll simulate multiple resizes and ensure that moveInDOM is only called once after a delay.

I'll use a mock function for moveInDOM and track how many times it's called. After triggering several resize events, I'll wait a bit and check that moveInDOM was called the expected number of times.

Finally, I'll compare the editor's position and size after resizing to ensure everything updated correctly.

```javascript
it("should update font size without blocking UI", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { createIdFactory } = await import("../../src/core/util.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");

  const idFactory = createIdFactory();
  const params = buildGetDocumentParams(idFactory);
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    parent: {
      pageIndex: 0,
      moveEditorInDOM: () => {},
      setSelected: () => {},
      setParent: () => {},
      viewport: {
        rotation: 0,
        pageWidth: 100,
        pageHeight: 100,
      },
    },
    uiManager: {},
    id: "test-editor",
    x: 10,
    y: 20,
  });

  editor.width = 0.5;
  editor.height = 0.5;
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  const mockMoveInDOM = jest.fn();
  editor.moveInDOM = mockMoveInDOM;

  // Simulate font size changes
  editor.height = 0.6;
  editor.width = 0.6;
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  // Check that moveInDOM is debounced and called only once
  expect(mockMoveInDOM).toHaveBeenCalled();
  const [x, y] = [editor.x, editor.y];
  expect(x).toBeCloseTo(0.1);
  expect(y).toBeCloseTo(0.2);
});
```

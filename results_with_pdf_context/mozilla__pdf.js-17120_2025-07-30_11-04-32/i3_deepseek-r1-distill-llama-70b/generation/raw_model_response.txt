Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where new code scanning alerts appeared in the pdf.js project. The problem was that some old, debugging code in the cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js files was causing alerts. The patch removes these files, so the test should ensure that this code no longer exists or causes issues.

First, I'll look at the test file provided. It's test/unit/crypto_spec.js, which imports several modules from the crypto.js and primitives.js files. I can reuse these imports if needed, but I might need to import others as well.

The task is to write exactly one test block that fails before the patch and passes after. Since the patch removes the two JavaScript files, the test should check that these files are no longer present or that their functionality isn't used.

I think the best approach is to check that the CFFEncodingMap, CFFDictDataMap, and CFFDictPrivateDataMap variables are no longer defined. If they are, that means the old code is still present, which would cause the test to fail before the patch.

So, in the test, I'll import cffStandardStrings.js and check if these variables are undefined. If they are undefined, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function. I'll use async/await since the import is dynamic. I'll import cffStandardStrings.js inside the test block and then check each variable.

I should also make sure that the test doesn't have any side effects. Since the variables are removed in the patch, after the patch, the test should pass because the variables won't be defined.

So, the test will look something like this: import the module, then check if each variable is undefined. If any are defined, the test fails.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and only tests the presence of these variables. That way, it accurately reflects whether the patch has been applied correctly.

```javascript
it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { CFFEncodingMap, CFFDictDataMap, CFFDictPrivateDataMap } = await import("../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js");
  expect(CFFEncodingMap).toBeUndefined();
  expect(CFFDictDataMap).toBeUndefined();
  expect(CFFDictPrivateDataMap).toBeUndefined();
});
```

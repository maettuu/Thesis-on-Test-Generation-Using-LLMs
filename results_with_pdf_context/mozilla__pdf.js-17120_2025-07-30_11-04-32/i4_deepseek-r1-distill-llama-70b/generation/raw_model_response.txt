Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some debugging code in pdf.js was causing new code scanning alerts. The patch provided removes the unused files cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js. So, the test should check that these files are no longer present after the patch.

First, I'll structure the test using Jest. The test should fail before the patch because the files exist, and pass after because they don't.

I'll use the 'fs' module to check if the files exist. Since the test needs to be self-contained, I'll use dynamic imports, but since 'fs' is a Node.js module, I'll require it directly.

In the test, I'll define the paths to the files. Then, I'll write a function to check if each file exists. I'll expect that both files do not exist. If they do, the test should fail.

I need to make sure the test is async and uses try-catch blocks to handle any errors, like if the files are found. If any file exists, the test will throw an error.

So, putting it all together, the test will import 'fs', define the file paths, check each file's existence, and assert that they don't exist. If they do, the test fails, indicating the patch didn't remove them.

```javascript
it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { default: fs } = await import('fs/promises');
  const cffStandardStringsPath = require.resolve('../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js');
  const fontsUtilsPath = require.resolve('../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js');

  async function fileExists(filePath) {
    try {
      await fs.access(filePath);
      return true;
    } catch {
      return false;
    }
  }

  const cffStandardStringsExists = await fileExists(cffStandardStringsPath);
  const fontsUtilsExists = await fileExists(fontsUtilsPath);

  expect(cffStandardStringsExists).toBe(false);
  expect(fontsUtilsExists).toBe(false);
});
```

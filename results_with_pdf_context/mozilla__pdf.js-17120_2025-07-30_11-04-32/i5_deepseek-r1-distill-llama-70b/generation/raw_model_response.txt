Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where new code scanning alerts appeared in the pdf.js project. The problem was related to some debugging code in the files cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js, which are no longer used and were causing alerts. The patch removes these files, so the test should ensure that this code is no longer present after the patch.

First, I should figure out what the test is checking. Since the files are removed, any test that relies on them should fail before the patch and pass after. But how can I test that the code is gone?

I think about importing the modules. Before the patch, importing cffStandardStrings.js would succeed because the file exists. After the patch, the file is deleted, so importing it should throw an error.

So the test will try to import the file and expect it to throw an error after the patch. That way, it ensures that the file is no longer present.

I need to structure the test using Jest. The test should be named something like "should remove unused CFF debugging code" and be an async function. Inside, I'll use a try-catch block to attempt importing the file. If it throws, that means the file is gone, which is what we want.

I'll use dynamic imports with await import() and wrap it in a try block. If the import succeeds, the test should fail because the file should have been removed. If it throws, the test passes.

I should also make sure to only import the necessary modules and not introduce new dependencies. Since the test is self-contained, it doesn't need any other imports beyond what's provided.

Putting it all together, the test will attempt to import the removed file and expect it to throw an error, confirming the patch worked.

```javascript
it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  try {
    const { CFFEncodingMap } = await import("../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js");
    throw new Error("Expected import to fail");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error && error.message !== "Cannot find module") {
      throw error;
    }
  }
});
```

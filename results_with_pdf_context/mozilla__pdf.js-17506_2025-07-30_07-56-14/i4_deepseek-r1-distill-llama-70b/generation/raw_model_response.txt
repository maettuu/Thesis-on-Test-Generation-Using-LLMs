Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the highlighting of images of text works correctly after the patch. The issue is that before the patch, highlighting might not have supported text images, and the patch adds this functionality.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It introduces a new way to handle highlights, especially for free-form text. The DrawLayer now has methods to handle free highlights, and the HighlightEditor uses these to create and update the highlights.

I'll need to simulate adding a free highlight and then rotating the page to see if the highlight adjusts correctly. The test should create a highlight, rotate the page, and check if the highlight's position and dimensions are updated as expected.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules, like DrawLayer and HighlightEditor. Then, I'll set up a mock viewport with a specific rotation. Creating a sample outline for the highlight and adding it to the DrawLayer will come next.

After adding the highlight, I'll rotate the page and check the highlight's box properties. I'll compare the expected box after rotation with the actual box from the DrawLayer to ensure they match.

I should make sure the test is self-contained, uses dynamic imports, and doesn't rely on any external dependencies beyond what's provided. The test must fail before the patch because the rotation handling for free highlights wasn't implemented, and pass after the patch since the issue is resolved.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle free text highlight after rotation", async () => {
  const { DrawLayer } = await import("../../src/display/draw_layer.js");
  const { HighlightEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/highlight.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");

  const viewport = {
    rawDims: { pageWidth: 100, pageHeight: 100 },
    rotation: 90,
  };

  const highlight = new HighlightEditor({
    color: "red",
    opacity: 1,
    pageIndex: 0,
    uiManager: {
      getMode: () => "highlight",
    },
  });

  const drawLayer = new DrawLayer({ pageIndex: 0 });
  drawLayer.setPageBox(viewport.rawDims);

  const outline = {
    box: {
      x: 0.1,
      y: 0.1,
      width: 0.2,
      height: 0.2,
    },
    toSVGPath: () => "M 0 0 L 1 1",
    free: () => true,
  };

  const id = drawLayer.highlight(outline, "red", 1, true);
  drawLayer.rotate(id, 90);

  const expectedBox = {
    x: 0.2,
    y: 0.2,
    width: 0.1,
    height: 0.2,
  };

  const actualBox = drawLayer.#mapping.get(id).getBoundingClientRect();

  expect(actualBox).toEqual(expectedBox);
});

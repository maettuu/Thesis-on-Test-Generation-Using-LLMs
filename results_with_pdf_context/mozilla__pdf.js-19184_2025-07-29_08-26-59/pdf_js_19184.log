[2025-07-29 08:33:02] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap Extension B Character Rendering", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters using codePointAt", async () => {
    const cmap = { 0x20: "\uD840\uDC00" }; // Example Extension B character
    const toUnicodeMap = new ToUnicodeMap(cmap);

    const expected = 0x20000; // Unicode code point for the character
    let actual;

    toUnicodeMap.forEach((charCode, unicode) => {
      if (charCode === "32") { // 0x20 in decimal
        actual = unicode;
      }
    });

    if (actual === undefined) {
      throw new Error("Character code not found in map.");
    }

    if (actual !== expected) {
      throw new Error(`Expected ${expected}, but got ${actual}.`);
    }
  });
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/to_unicode_map_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

[2025-07-29 08:40:53] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap Extension B Character Handling", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters", async () => {
    // Using U+1D11E MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF as test character
    const extensionBChar = String.fromCodePoint(0x1D11E);
    const map = new ToUnicodeMap();
    map.amend({ [0]: extensionBChar });

    const expectedCodePoint = 0x1D11E;
    let actualCodePoints = [];

    map.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
      actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
    });

    expect(actualCodePoints).toContain(expectedCodePoint);
  });
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/to_unicode_map_spec.js` file before running it.

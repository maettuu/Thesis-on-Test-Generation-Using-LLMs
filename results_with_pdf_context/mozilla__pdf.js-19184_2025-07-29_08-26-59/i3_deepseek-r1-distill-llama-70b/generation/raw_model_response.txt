Okay, I need to create a regression test for the bug where Extension B characters in form fields aren't rendering correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the ToUnicodeMap's forEach method to use codePointAt(0) instead of charCodeAt(0). 

First, I should understand what this change does. charCodeAt(0) returns the Unicode code point of the first character as a 16-bit number, which might not handle characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) correctly. codePointAt(0) returns the full Unicode code point, which can handle characters above U+FFFF, like those in Extension B.

So, the test needs to check if the ToUnicodeMap correctly maps these characters. I'll create a test that uses a known Unicode character from Extension B, like U+1D11E (which is a musical symbol G clef). 

I'll set up a ToUnicodeMap instance with this character. Then, I'll use the forEach method to iterate through the map and collect the values. The test expects that the correct code point is returned. Before the patch, this would fail because charCodeAt(0) would return an incorrect value, but after the patch, it should return the correct code point.

I'll structure the test using Mocha's describe and it functions. I'll import ToUnicodeMap from the correct path. In the test, I'll initialize the map with the Extension B character, iterate through it, and check if the collected values include the correct code point.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I won't add any external dependencies beyond the provided imports. The test should fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the issue is resolved.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap Extension B Character Handling", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters", async () => {
    // Using U+1D11E MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF as test character
    const extensionBChar = String.fromCodePoint(0x1D11E);
    const map = new ToUnicodeMap();
    map.amend({ [0]: extensionBChar });

    const expectedCodePoint = 0x1D11E;
    let actualCodePoints = [];

    map.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
      actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
    });

    expect(actualCodePoints).toContain(expectedCodePoint);
  });
});
```

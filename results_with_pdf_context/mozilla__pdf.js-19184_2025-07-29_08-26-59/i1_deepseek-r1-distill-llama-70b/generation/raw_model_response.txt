Okay, I need to create a regression test for the bug where Extension B characters in form fields don't render correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the way character codes are retrieved in the ToUnicodeMap class. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code used charCodeAt(0) in the forEach method, which might not handle Unicode characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) correctly. The patch replaces it with codePointAt(0), which should handle all Unicode code points, including those above U+FFFF.

So, the test needs to verify that after the patch, the correct Unicode code points are retrieved. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is about the ToUnicodeMap, I'll import it from the correct path. I might also need some test utilities, so I'll check the available imports and include './test_utils.js' for any necessary functions.

Next, I'll structure the test. I'll create a describe block for the ToUnicodeMap and an it block for the specific test case. The test should create a ToUnicodeMap instance with known mappings, including some Extension B characters. 

I'll define a sample cmap where each key is a character code string, and the value is the corresponding Unicode character. For example, I'll include a BMP character like 'A' and an Extension B character like 'üßëüèª', which is U+1F9D1.

Then, I'll initialize the ToUnicodeMap with this cmap. I'll create an array to collect the expected code points. Using the forEach method, I'll loop through the map and push each code point into the array.

I'll define the expected array with the correct code points. For 'A', it's 65, and for 'üßëüèª', it's 0x1F9D1. 

In the test, I'll compare the collected actual code points with the expected array. If they match, the test passes, indicating the patch works.

I need to ensure that this test would fail before the patch because charCodeAt(0) would return an incorrect value for the Extension B character, but after the patch, codePointAt(0) will return the correct value.

I should also make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external files or dependencies beyond the provided imports. 

Putting it all together, I'll write the test file with the necessary imports, describe block, and it block, ensuring that the test correctly validates the behavior before and after the patch.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";
import { expect } from "../../web/test_utils/testreporter.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters", async () => {
    // Create a test cmap with Extension B characters
    const cmap = {
      "0": "A", // BMP character
      "1": "üßëüèª" // Extension B character (U+1F9D1)
    };
    
    const toUnicodeMap = new ToUnicodeMap(cmap);
    const expectedCodePoints = [65, 0x1F9D1]; // 65 is 'A', 0x1F9D1 is 'üßëüèª'
    const actualCodePoints = [];
    
    toUnicodeMap.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
      actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
    });
    
    expect(actualCodePoints).toEqual(expectedCodePoints);
  });
});
```

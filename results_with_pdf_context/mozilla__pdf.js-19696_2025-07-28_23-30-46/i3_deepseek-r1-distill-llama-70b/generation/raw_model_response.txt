Okay, I need to write a regression test for the PDF.js project. The issue is that the £ symbol isn't displaying correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, so my test should verify that this patch fixes the problem.

First, I'll look at the problem details. The user mentioned that when opening the attached PDF, the £ symbol (U+00A3) is showing as ά (U+03AC). The patch adds a line to the glyph map for Calibri fonts, mapping 940 to 163. I think this means that the CID 940 now correctly points to the £ glyph.

So, my test should check if the £ symbol is rendered correctly after applying the patch. I'll need to use the provided PDF file, issue19695.pdf, which contains the problematic symbol.

I'll start by setting up the test. I'll import the necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. Then, I'll create a loading task for the PDF document.

Next, I'll load the specific page where the £ symbol is located. The user didn't specify the page number, but I'll assume it's on page 1. I'll get the first page and render it, making sure the text is parsed.

After rendering, I'll extract the text content. I'll search for the £ symbol in the text. If the patch is correct, the text should include '£' instead of the wrong character.

I'll write an assertion to check if '£' is present in the text. If it's there, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test as an async function within an it block, using Jest or similar testing framework syntax.

I also need to ensure that the test will fail before the patch and pass after. Since the patch adjusts the glyph mapping, the test should correctly reflect this change.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure to handle any potential errors, like the page not loading or the text not being found. But since this is a focused test, I'll keep it straightforward.

```javascript
it("should correctly render £ symbol (U+00A3) instead of ά (U+03AC)", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19695.pdf'));
  
  const { numPages, page } = await loadingTask;
  const page1 = await page(1);
  
  const textContent = await page1.getTextContent();
  const actualText = textContent.items[0].str;
  
  expect(actualText).toContain('£');
});
```

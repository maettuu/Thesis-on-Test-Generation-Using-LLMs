Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the £ symbol isn't displaying correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, so the test should verify that the patch fixes the problem.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The £ symbol, which is U+00A3, was showing up as U+03AC. The patch adds a line to the glyph map in standard_fonts.js, specifically t[940] = 163. I think this maps the glyph index 940 to the correct Unicode code point 163, which is £.

So, the test needs to check if the £ symbol is rendered correctly after applying the patch. I'll use the provided PDF file, issue19695.pdf, which contains the problematic symbol.

I'll structure the test using Jest. The test will load the PDF, extract the text from the first page, and check if the £ symbol is present correctly.

I'll import getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js to set up the PDF loading. Then, I'll create a loading task and wait for the PDF to load. Once loaded, I'll get the first page and extract its text.

The text extraction might involve using the TextLayer, so I'll import TextLayer from the display/text_layer.js. After the text is extracted, I'll search for the £ symbol. If it's found, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with async/await for proper handling of asynchronous operations. The test will fail before the patch because the £ symbol isn't correctly mapped, and after the patch, it should pass.

So, putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, extract the text, and assert that the £ symbol is present. This should confirm that the patch resolves the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly display £ symbol (U+00A3) after patch", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const { TextLayer } = await import('../../src/display/text_layer.js');
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19695.pdf'));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textLayer = new TextLayer({
    page,
    container: document.createElement('div'),
    viewport: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 }),
  });
  
  const text = await textLayer.getTextContent();
  expect(text.items.some(item => item.str.includes('£'))).toBe(true);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where only supported image types should be allowed when selecting an image in the stamp annotation. The patch adds a list of supported types and sets the input's accept attribute to StampEditor.supportedTypes. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, the input accepted "image/*", which allows all image types. The patch changes this to only accept specific image types. So the test needs to check that after the patch, only those specific types are allowed.

I'll use Jest for the test. I'll create a test that checks the accept attribute of the input element created by the StampEditor. 

I'll import the necessary modules: StampEditor from the correct path and expect from 'expect'. 

In the test, I'll create a StampEditor instance. Then, I'll trigger the file input by creating a fake event, like a click on the element. This should create the input element. 

Once the input is created, I'll check its 'accept' attribute. It should be the same as StampEditor.supportedTypes, which is a comma-separated string of MIME types. 

I'll write an async function inside the test block. I'll use Jest's expect to assert that the accept attribute includes the expected types. 

Wait, but how do I trigger the creation of the input element? The StampEditor's constructor might not create it immediately. Maybe I need to call some method that triggers the creation, like initializing the editor. Alternatively, perhaps the input is created when the editor is set up. 

Looking at the patch, the input is created in the constructor when the #bitmapUrl is set. So when I create the StampEditor, the input should be created. 

I'll proceed by creating the editor, then check the input's accept attribute. 

I need to make sure that the test fails before the patch and passes after. Before the patch, the accept was "image/*", so the test would fail because it's expecting specific types. After the patch, it should pass.

I should structure the test to import the necessary modules, create the editor, and then check the accept attribute. 

I'll write the test using async/await for any promises, but in this case, creating the editor might not require waiting. 

So the test will look something like this: create the editor, get the input element, and assert that the accept attribute matches the expected string.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should only accept supported image types when selecting an image", async () => {
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/stamp.js");
  const editor = new StampEditor();
  
  const input = editor._uiManager._input;
  const expectedTypes = StampEditor.supportedTypes;
  
  expect(input.accept).toBe(expectedTypes);
});
```

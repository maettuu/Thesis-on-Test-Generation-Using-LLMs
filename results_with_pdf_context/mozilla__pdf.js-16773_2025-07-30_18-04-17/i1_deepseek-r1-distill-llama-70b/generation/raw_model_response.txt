Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where only supported image types should be allowed when selecting an image in the stamp annotation. The patch provided adds a list of supported image types and sets the input's accept attribute to use these types instead of "image/*".

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. Before the patch, the input accepted any image type, which could lead to unsupported formats being used. The patch restricts this to specific types, so the test should verify that this restriction is enforced.

I'll create a test file that imports necessary modules. Since the test is for the StampEditor, I'll need to import it along with other dependencies like AnnotationEditor and the supportedTypes from the shared utilities.

The test suite will be named "StampEditor" and the test case will check if the supported image types are correctly set. I'll use describe and it blocks for this.

In the test, I'll initialize the StampEditor and check its supportedTypes. I'll create an array of expected types and compare it with the value from StampEditor.supportedTypes. This will ensure that the patch correctly sets the supported types.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using async functions and proper imports without adding new dependencies. The test should fail before the patch because the supportedTypes would be "image/*", and pass after the patch since it will match the expected list.

I'll structure the code with the necessary imports, describe block, and it block. The test will compare the expected types with the actual supportedTypes from StampEditor.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring it's clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra comments or explanations beyond the provided example structure.

```javascript
import { StampEditor } from "../../display/editor/stamp.js";
import { AnnotationEditorType } from "../../shared/util.js";

describe("StampEditor", () => {
  it("should only accept supported image types", async () => {
    const editor = new StampEditor({} as unknown as AnnotationEditorType);
    const expectedTypes = [
      "image/apng",
      "image/avif",
      "image/bmp",
      "image/gif",
      "image/jpeg",
      "image/png",
      "image/svg+xml",
      "image/webp",
      "image/x-icon",
    ].join(",");
    
    expect(editor.constructor.supportedTypes).toBe(expectedTypes);
  });
});
```

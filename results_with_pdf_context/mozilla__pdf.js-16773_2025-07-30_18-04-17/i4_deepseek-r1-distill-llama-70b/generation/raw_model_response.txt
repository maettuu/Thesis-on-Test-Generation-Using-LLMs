Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the stamp annotation editor was allowing unsupported image types. The patch adds a list of supported image types, so the test should ensure that only those types are accepted.

First, I'll create a test case using Jest. The test should check if the input accept attribute correctly reflects the supported types after the patch.

I'll import the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required files. I'll need the StampEditor class and the Util module for shadowing.

Next, I'll set up a mock for the UI Manager and the HTML input element. I'll create a new StampEditor instance with a dummy bitmap URL to simulate the scenario.

I'll define the expected supported types as a string, which is a comma-separated list of MIME types. Then, I'll get the actual accept attribute from the input element created by the editor.

Finally, I'll compare the expected and actual accept attributes to ensure they match. This will confirm that the editor now enforces the supported image types correctly.

```javascript
it("should only allow supported image types when selecting an image", async () => {
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../display/editor/stamp.js");
  const { shadow } = await import("../../shared/util.js");

  const supportedTypes = [
    "image/apng",
    "image/avif",
    "image/bmp",
    "image/gif",
    "image/jpeg",
    "image/png",
    "image/svg+xml",
    "image/webp",
    "image/x-icon"
  ].join(",");

  const uiManager = {
    imageManager: {
      getFromId: () => null,
      getFromUrl: () => null,
      deleteId: () => null,
      isValidId: () => false
    }
  };

  const editor = new StampEditor({
    bitmapUrl: "test.jpg",
    parent: null,
    uiManager: uiManager,
    pageIndex: 0
  });

  const input = document.createElement("input");
  input.type = "file";
  
  const expectedAccept = supportedTypes;
  const actualAccept = input.accept;

  expect(actualAccept).toBe(expectedAccept);
});
```

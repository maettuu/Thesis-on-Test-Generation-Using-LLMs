Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the JPX fuzzer was spamming the output with "OpenJPEG: Unknown format" logs. The patch provided modifies the decode method in jpx.js to throw a JpxError with the message from OpenJPEG instead of a generic one. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, when decode failed, it threw a JpxError with "JPX decode failed". After the patch, it checks if imageData is a string, which probably contains the error message from OpenJPEG, like "Unknown format", and throws that instead.

So the test needs to verify that when a failure occurs, the error message is the specific one from OpenJPEG, not the generic one. 

I'll use the test_utils.js to create a test. I'll import JpxImage from jpx.js. Then, I'll create a mock data that causes the decode to fail. 

In the test, I'll call JpxImage.decode with this data and check if the error message matches the expected one. 

I need to make sure that the test fails before the patch because the error message would be "JPX decode failed", and passes after the patch because it's "Unknown format".

I'll structure the test with an async function, use try-catch to handle the error, and assert the message.

I should also ensure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided.

So, the steps are: import JpxImage, set up bad data, call decode, catch the error, and check the message.

```javascript
it("should throw specific error message when JPX decode fails", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const badData = new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0]); // Corrupted JPX data

  try {
    await JpxImage.decode(badData, false);
    assert.fail("Expected JpxError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error && error.message === "JPX error: Unknown format") {
      // Expected error message after patch
      return;
    }
    assert.fail("Expected error message 'Unknown format' but got something else");
  }
});
```

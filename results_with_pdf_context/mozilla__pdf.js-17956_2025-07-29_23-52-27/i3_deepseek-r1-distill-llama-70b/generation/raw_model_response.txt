Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the JPX fuzzer was spamming the output with "OpenJPEG: Unknown format" logs. The patch provided modifies the decode function in jpx.js to throw a JpxError with the message from the OpenJPEG module instead of a generic message.

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, when decode failed, it threw a JpxError with the message "JPX decode failed". After the patch, if the module returns a string, it's thrown as the error message. So, the test needs to check that the error message now includes the specific OpenJPEG error, like "Unknown format".

I'll use the existing test file structure. Since the test is for the JpxImage.decode method, I'll import JpxImage from the correct path. I'll write an it block that tests this scenario.

I'll create a mock data that causes OpenJPEG to return a string error. Then, I'll call decode with this data and check if the error message matches. I'll use Jest's expect with toThrow and toMatch to verify the error.

I need to make sure that the test fails before the patch because the error message was generic, and passes after because it includes the specific message. So, the test will only pass after the patch is applied.

I should also handle any potential issues, like ensuring the mock data is correct and that the test doesn't have any side effects. Since this is a unit test, I'll keep it self-contained and focused on the specific behavior.

Finally, I'll structure the test with the necessary imports, setup, and assertions to clearly show the expected outcome.

```javascript
it("should throw specific OpenJPEG error message", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const mockData = new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0]); // Sample invalid JPX data

  await expect(JpxImage.decode(mockData, false)).rejects.toThrow(
    new Error("JPX error: Unknown format")
  );
});
```

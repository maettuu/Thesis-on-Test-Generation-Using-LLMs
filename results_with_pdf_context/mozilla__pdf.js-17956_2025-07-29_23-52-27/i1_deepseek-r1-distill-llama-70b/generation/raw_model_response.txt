Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where the JPX fuzzer is spamming the output with "OpenJPEG: Unknown format" logs. The patch provided changes the decode method in jpx.js to throw a JpxError with the message from imageData when it's a string. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, the decode method would throw a generic "JPX decode failed" error if imageData was falsy. Now, it checks if imageData is a string, which probably contains the error message from the OpenJPEG library, like "Unknown format". So the test needs to verify that this specific error is thrown when trying to decode an invalid JPX file.

I'll use the test file provided, which is test/unit/cff_parser_spec.js. I can add an it block there. I need to import the necessary modules. Since the test is about JPX decoding, I'll import JpxImage from '../../src/core/jpx.js' and the JpxError from '../shared/util.js'.

In the test, I'll create a sample invalid JPX data. Maybe just an empty buffer or some garbage data. Then, I'll call JpxImage.decode with this data. I expect it to throw a JpxError with the message "Unknown format".

I should structure the test using async/await since the decode method might be asynchronous. I'll wrap the decode call in a try-catch block and check if the error is caught correctly.

So, the steps are:
1. Import JpxImage and JpxError.
2. Create invalid JPX data.
3. Try to decode it and expect a JpxError with the specific message.
4. Use expect().toThrow() to verify the error.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific behavior. Also, since the test is in the existing test file, I don't need to set up anything else. 

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should throw JpxError with OpenJPEG error message", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const { JpxError } = await import("../shared/util.js");
  const invalidJpxData = new Uint8Array(10); // Invalid JPX data

  const decodePromise = JpxImage.decode(invalidJpxData, false);
  await expect(decodePromise).rejects.toThrow(JpxError);
  const error = await decodePromise.catch(err => err);
  expect(error.message).toBe("Unknown format");
});
```

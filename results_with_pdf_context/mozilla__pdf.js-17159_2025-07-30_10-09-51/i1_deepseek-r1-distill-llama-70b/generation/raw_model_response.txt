Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where radio buttons in the print view don't reflect their real state on the PDF form. The patch provided modifies the `_processRadioButton` method in `annotation.js`. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code set both `this.data.fieldValue` and `this.data.buttonValue` to null. The patch changes this so that only `this.data.buttonValue` is set to null. This suggests that the `fieldValue` was being incorrectly reset, causing the radio button's state not to show correctly in print view.

So, the test needs to check if the radio button's state is correctly reflected after the patch. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test file already has some imports, I can use those. I'll need to get the PDF document, so I'll import `getDocument` and `buildGetDocumentParams` from the appropriate paths.

Next, I'll create an async function within the test block. I'll load the PDF document using `getDocument` with the provided file path. Once loaded, I'll get the first page and its annotations.

I'll loop through the annotations to find the radio button widget. Once found, I'll check its `data` property. Specifically, I'm interested in `buttonValue` and `fieldValue`. 

Before the patch, both might be null or incorrect. After the patch, `buttonValue` should correctly reflect the radio button's state, while `fieldValue` should not be null if it's part of a radio group. 

I'll set up an expectation that `buttonValue` is not null and that `fieldValue` exists, ensuring the state is correctly set. This should fail before the patch and pass after.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll include all necessary imports within the test block. I'll structure the test to retrieve the annotation, check the data properties, and assert the expected values.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it only returns the JavaScript code for the `it` block without any extra comments or explanations.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1860602.pdf'));
  
  const { doc, annotations } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await doc.getPage(1);
  const annots = await page.getAnnotations();
  
  const radioButtonAnnotation = annots.find(annotation => {
    return annotation instanceof ButtonWidgetAnnotation &&
           annotation.data.radioButton &&
           !annotation.data.checkBox &&
           !annotation.data.pushButton;
  });

  expect(radioButtonAnnotation.data.buttonValue).toBeTruthy();
  expect(radioButtonAnnotation.data.fieldValue).toBeTruthy();
});
```

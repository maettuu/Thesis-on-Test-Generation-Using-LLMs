Okay, so I need to write a regression test for this issue where radio buttons in the print view don't reflect their real state on the PDF form. The patch provided modifies the `annotation.js` file, specifically the `_processRadioButton` method. 

First, I should understand what the issue is. Radio buttons not reflecting their real state means that when you print the form, the checked state of the radio buttons isn't shown correctly in the PDF. So, the test needs to check if the radio buttons' appearances are correctly captured in the print view.

Looking at the patch, the change is in `annotation.js`. The original code sets both `fieldValue` and `buttonValue` to null. The patch removes `fieldValue`, so now only `buttonValue` is set to null. This suggests that `fieldValue` is important for correctly tracking the radio button's state.

To write the test, I'll need to:

1. Load the PDF file 'bug1860602.pdf' using `getDocument` from `api.js` and `buildGetDocumentParams` from `test_utils.js`.
2. Get the first page of the document.
3. Render the annotations (radio buttons) and check their state.
4. Ensure that after the patch, the radio buttons' states are correctly reflected.

I should create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. So, the test will load the PDF, access the radio button widget, and check if the correct state is stored in `data.fieldValue`.

In the test, I'll use `await page.getTextContent()` to get the text, but since it's a radio button, I might need to directly access the annotation's data. I'll retrieve the first annotation, assuming it's a radio button, and check if `data.fieldValue` is as expected.

The expected value for the radio button's state should be 'On' if it's checked. So, I'll compare the actual value from the annotation to this expected value.

Putting it all together, the test will import necessary modules, load the PDF, get the page, render the annotations, and assert the correct state.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1860602.pdf'));
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  const annotation = annotations[0];
  const widget = annotation.getWidget();
  const expectedValue = 'On';
  const actualValue = widget.data.fieldValue;
  expect(actualValue).toBe(expectedValue);
});
```

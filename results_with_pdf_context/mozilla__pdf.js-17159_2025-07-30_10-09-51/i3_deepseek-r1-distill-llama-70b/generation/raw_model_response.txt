Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the fix for the issue where radio buttons in print view don't reflect their real state. The patch provided modifies the ButtonWidgetAnnotation class in annotation.js. Let me see what the patch does.

Looking at the patch, the _processRadioButton method in ButtonWidgetAnnotation had a line where this.data.fieldValue was set to null. The patch changed that line to set this.data.buttonValue to null instead. This suggests that the issue was related to how the radio button's state was being stored, possibly affecting both display and printing.

My test needs to check if the radio button's state is correctly reflected in the PDF when printed. So, I'll create a test that generates a PDF with radio buttons, checks their state, and ensures that after the patch, the state is correctly rendered.

First, I'll set up the test environment. I'll import the necessary modules, including the PDF file 'bug1860602.pdf' which contains the radio buttons. I'll use getDocument from the display API to load the PDF.

I'll create a test case where I load the PDF, get the first page, render it, and then check the annotations. The annotations should include the radio buttons. I'll extract the radio button annotation and check its state.

Before the patch, the radio button's state might not be correctly reflected. After the patch, the state should be correct. So, I'll write assertions to check that the fieldValue and buttonValue are as expected.

I'll also need to handle the asynchronous nature of loading the PDF and rendering the page. Using async/await will help manage this.

I'll structure the test to load the PDF, get the page, render it, extract the annotations, and then make the necessary checks. This should ensure that the radio buttons' states are correctly handled in the print view after the patch.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1860602.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
  const pageIndex = 0;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(pageIndex);
  const annotator = page.getAnnotations();
  const annotations = await annotator.getAnnotations();
  
  const annotation = annotations.find(annot => annot instanceof Annotation);
  const buttonAnnotation = new ButtonWidgetAnnotation({
    dict: annotation.dict,
    xref: new XRefMock(),
    annotationGlobals: {},
    id: createIdFactory(),
    collectFields: true,
    pageRef: new Ref(0)
  });
  
  assert.equal(buttonAnnotation.data.fieldValue, null);
  assert.equal(buttonAnnotation.data.buttonValue, "Yes");
});
```

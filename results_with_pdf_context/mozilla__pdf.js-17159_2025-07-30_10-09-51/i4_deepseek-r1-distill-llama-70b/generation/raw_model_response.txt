Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the radio buttons in the print view reflect their real state correctly. The issue is that before the patch, the radio buttons don't show their actual state when printed. The patch modifies the code in annotation.js, specifically in the ButtonWidgetAnnotation class where the _processRadioButton method is changed.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code sets both fieldValue and buttonValue to null. The patch changes it so that only buttonValue is set to null, leaving fieldValue untouched. This probably ensures that the correct state is preserved for radio buttons.

Now, to write the test. I'll need to load the PDF file, which is 'bug1860602.pdf'. I'll get the first page and the annotations. Then, I'll look for the radio button annotation. Once I find it, I'll check its state.

I'll use the getDocument function from the API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. After loading the document, I'll get the first page and then the annotations.

I'll loop through the annotations to find the one with subtype 'Btn' and fieldType 'Ch', which is a radio button. Once found, I'll check its fieldValue and buttonValue. Before the patch, these might not reflect the correct state, causing the test to fail. After the patch, they should match, making the test pass.

I'll structure the test with an async function inside the it block. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically. Then, I'll load the PDF, get the page, and the annotations. I'll search for the radio button and then compare the fieldValue and buttonValue. The test should assert that they are the same, indicating the correct state is reflected.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific behavior. I'll also handle any errors that might occur during loading.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it follows the structure provided and only includes the necessary steps to verify the fix.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1860602.pdf'));
  
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(0);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  
  let radioAnnotation;
  for (const annotation of annotations) {
    const { subtype, fieldType } = annotation.data;
    if (subtype === 'Widget' && fieldType === 'Ch') {
      radioAnnotation = annotation;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  const expectedValue = radioAnnotation.data.fieldValue;
  const actualValue = radioAnnotation.data.buttonValue;
  
  expect(expectedValue).toBe(actualValue);
});
```

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for this bug where PDFs with non-integer DW aren't rendered correctly. The patch changes how the default width is calculated in evaluator.js. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code checks if DW is an integer and uses it, else defaults to 1000. The patch changes it to use Math.ceil(dw) if it's a number, regardless of being integer. So, for non-integer DW values like 500.5, it'll take 501.

Now, to test this, I need a PDF where DW is a non-integer. The user provided bug1903731.pdf. I can use that.

The test should fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll write a test that checks if the defaultWidth is correctly set when DW is a non-integer.

I'll need to get the PDF document, extract the font dictionary, and check the defaultWidth. If the test passes, it means the patch works.

I'll use getDocument from display/api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll load the PDF, get the first page, and access the font's properties. I'll expect the defaultWidth to be the ceiling of the DW value in the PDF.

I'll structure the test with an async function, load the PDF, get the page, and check the font properties. If the defaultWidth matches the expected value, the test passes.

I should make sure to import the necessary modules dynamically and handle any potential errors, but since it's a test, I can assume the PDF loads correctly.

So, putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, extract the font's defaultWidth, and assert it's correct after the patch.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle non-integer DW values in font descriptors", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1903731.pdf'));
  
  const { pdfDocument } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const font = await page.getFont();
  const defaultWidth = font.properties.defaultWidth;
  
  expect(defaultWidth).toBe(501);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the PDF with a non-integer DW is rendered correctly after the patch. The issue was that such PDFs weren't rendering properly, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. I'll use getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll load the specific PDF file, bug1903731.pdf.

I'll create a function to check if the PDF page has text. This function will use getTextContent from the evaluator. If it finds text, it returns true; otherwise, false.

Next, I'll set up the test. I'll use Jest's it function with an async callback. Inside, I'll get the document, extract the first page, and create a text layer. Then, I'll use the hasText function to check if the page has text.

The expectation is that hasText should return true, meaning the text is correctly rendered. Before the patch, this might have failed because the DW value caused issues, but after the patch, it should pass.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses only the provided imports. I'll structure the code to import dynamically for Node.js compatibility and ensure no new dependencies are added.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's concise and to the point, focusing on verifying the fix for the specific PDF issue.

```javascript
it("should render PDF with non-integer DW correctly", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1903731.pdf'));

  async function hasText(page) {
    const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
    const textContent = await page.getTextContent({
      textsEl: page.textLayer,
      normalizeWhitespace: true
    });
    return textContent.items.some(item => item.str.length > 0);
  }

  const { numPages, getPage } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await getPage(1);
  const textLayer = page.textLayer;
  await textLayer.setup(textLayer);
  const hasPageText = await hasText(page);

  expect(hasPageText).toBe(true);
});

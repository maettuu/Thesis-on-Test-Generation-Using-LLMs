Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF with a non-integer DW isn't rendered correctly. The patch changes how the default width is calculated in the evaluator.js file. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before, if DW wasn't an integer, it defaulted to 1000. Now, it takes the ceiling of DW if it's a number. So, for example, if DW was 500.5, it would become 501.

I need to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should load the provided PDF, check the page's width, and ensure it's correct.

I'll use the test_utils.js to get the PDF document. Then, I'll load the first page and get its viewport to find the width. 

I'll set an expectation that the width, when DW is non-integer, is correctly calculated using Math.ceil. So, if the PDF has a DW of, say, 500.5, the width should be 501 after the patch.

Before the patch, the same PDF would have a default width of 1000, so the test would fail. After the patch, it should pass.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, import necessary modules, load the PDF, get the page, and check the width. I'll use async/await for the asynchronous operations.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific behavior. No extra dependencies are needed beyond what's provided.

So, the test will import getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams, load the PDF, get the first page, and then the viewport's width. It will then compare it to the expected value based on the patch.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should render PDF with non-integer DW correctly", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1903731.pdf'));
  const { numPages, getPage } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewPort({ scale: 1 });
  
  expect(viewport.width).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1000);
});
```

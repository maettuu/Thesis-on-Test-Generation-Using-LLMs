Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF with a non-integer DW isn't rendered correctly. The patch changes how defaultWidth is calculated in evaluator.js. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand the problem. The PDF has a DW value that's not an integer, which was causing rendering issues. The patch replaces Number.isInteger with typeof checks and uses Math.ceil if it's a number.

I need to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should open the specific PDF and check if the text is rendered correctly.

Looking at the existing test file, evaluator_spec.js, I can use the setup they have. I'll import the necessary modules like getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams.

In the test, I'll load the PDF using getDocument. Then, I'll get the first page and its operator list. I'll create a PartialEvaluator with the necessary options, probably setting disableFontFace to true to avoid actual font rendering.

Next, I'll process the page's operator list with the evaluator. This should parse the fonts and their widths correctly.

I'll then check the glyphsWidths array to see if it's populated. If it's empty, that means the parsing failed, which would be the case before the patch. After the patch, it should have the correct widths.

So, the test will assert that glyphsWidths is not empty. Before the patch, this assertion would fail because the code didn't handle non-integer DW correctly, leading to an empty array. After the patch, it should pass.

I also need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external factors. Using the provided PDF and the specific page ensures consistency.

I should structure the test with async/await since getDocument and other functions are asynchronous. I'll use try-catch to handle any errors during loading or processing.

Putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, process it, and check the glyph widths. This should validate that the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly render PDF with non-integer DW", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1903731.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const { doc, cleanup } = await loadingTask;
    const page = await doc.getPage(0);
    const operatorList = await page.getOperatorList();
    
    const evaluatorOptions = {
      disableFontFace: true,
    };
    
    const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
      xref: page.xref,
      handler: null,
      pageIndex: page.index,
      idFactory: createIdFactory(),
      fontCache: null,
      builtInCMapCache: null,
      standardFontDataCache: null,
      globalImageCache: null,
      systemFontCache: null,
      options: evaluatorOptions,
    });
    
    const properties = {
      composite: true,
    };
    
    const dict = new Dict();
    dict.set("Type", "/Font");
    dict.set("Subtype", "/Type1");
    dict.set("BaseFont", "Helvetica");
    
    evaluator.extractWidths(dict, {}, properties);
    
    const glyphsWidths = properties.widths;
    
    expect(glyphsWidths.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    
    await cleanup();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Failed to load or process PDF");
  }
});

Okay, I need to write a test for the issue where a PDF with a token 'toString' in the stream causes an error because it's considered a valid operator. The patch changes the opMap to use a null-prototype object to prevent default properties like 'toString' from being recognized as valid commands.

First, I'll look at the test file provided. It imports necessary modules and has some setup. I'll need to create a test case that uses the 'issue17554.pdf' file.

The test should check if the PDF is read correctly after the patch. Before the patch, this PDF would cause an error because 'toString' is treated as a valid operator. After the patch, it should be ignored, and the PDF should load without issues.

I'll use getDocument to load the PDF and check if it can be read without throwing an error. The test will attempt to get the first page and render it, expecting it to resolve successfully.

I'll structure the test with try-catch to handle any errors. If the promise resolves, it means the PDF was processed correctly, so the test passes. If it catches an error, the test fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific issue. I'll import the necessary modules and set up the test case within the 'it' block.

```javascript
it("should ignore 'toString' as an invalid PDF operator", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue17554.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
    const firstPagePromise = pdfDocument.getPage(1);
    const pageRenderingPromise = firstPagePromise.then(page => page.render());
    await pageRenderingPromise;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof FormatError) {
      throw new Error("Failed to process PDF with 'toString' operator");
    }
  }
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF.js incorrectly treats default JavaScript object properties like `toString` as valid PDF operators. The test should fail before the patch and pass after applying the patch.

First, I'll look at the provided code and the patch. The problem was that the `opMap` was using a regular JavaScript object, which includes inherited properties like `toString`. The patch changes `opMap` to use `Object.create(null)`, ensuring it doesn't have these inherited properties.

To test this, I'll create a PDF that includes a stream with the `toString` token. The test will load this PDF and check if `toString` is treated as an invalid operator.

I'll use the existing test file `test/unit/evaluator_spec.js` and add a new test case. I'll import necessary modules like `PartialEvaluator` and `OperatorList` from the provided imports.

In the test, I'll set up a mock XRef and create a `StringStream` with the content containing `toString`. Then, I'll initialize the `PartialEvaluator` with this stream and XRef.

Next, I'll process the operator list. If `toString` is considered a valid operator, the processing should throw an error because `toString` doesn't have the expected properties like `id` or `numArgs`.

I'll wrap this in a try-catch block. If no error is thrown, the test fails because it means `toString` was incorrectly accepted as a valid operator. If an error is thrown, the test passes, indicating the patch works.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with `it` and include all necessary setup within the async function.

Finally, I'll return only the JavaScript code for the new test block without any comments or explanations.

```javascript
it("should ignore default object properties as operators", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const { OperatorList } = await import("../../src/core/operator_list.js");
  const { XRefMock } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const content = new StringStream("toString\n");
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator(
    content,
    xref,
    new StateManager(),
    new OperatorList()
  );

  const opList = evaluator.read();
  try {
    await evaluator.processOperatorList(opList);
    throw new Error("Expected error to be thrown for 'toString' operator");
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(Error);
  }
});
```

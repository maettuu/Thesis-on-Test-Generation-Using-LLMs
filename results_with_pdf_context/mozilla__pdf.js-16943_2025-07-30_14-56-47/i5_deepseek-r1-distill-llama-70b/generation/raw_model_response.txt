Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor was changed. The patch provided modifies the AnnotationEditor class and some of its subclasses. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch introduces a static property _borderLineWidth in AnnotationEditor, which is initialized in the static initialize method. This method checks if _borderLineWidth is -1 and then sets it based on a CSS variable. 

The patch also adds a method #getBaseTranslation which calculates some translation based on the border line width and the parent dimensions. This method is used in fixAndSetPosition to adjust the position of the editor. 

So, the test needs to verify that the border line width is correctly set and used to adjust the position. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports. I'll need the AnnotationEditor from editor.js and the PDFDocument from core/document.js.

Next, I'll create a sample PDF document. For testing, I can create a simple PDF with one page. I'll use the PDFDocument class from core/document.js. 

Then, I'll initialize the AnnotationEditor by calling its static initialize method. Since the initialize method uses getComputedStyle, which is part of the DOM, I might need to mock this in a Node.js environment. But since the test is in Node, perhaps I can set the CSS variables manually or find another way.

Wait, in the patch, the initialize method uses getComputedStyle on document.documentElement. In Node.js, document isn't available, so I might need to mock this. Alternatively, I can set the static _borderLineWidth directly to avoid relying on the DOM. 

But for the test to accurately reflect the behavior, I should simulate the CSS variable. Maybe I can set AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth to a known value before the test runs.

So, I'll set AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth to 2px, for example. Then, I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditor, set its parent dimensions, and call fixAndSetPosition.

After that, I'll check if the div's style properties for left and top are correctly calculated based on the border line width. The expected values should be 2% of the parent dimensions. 

Wait, in the code, the translation is x = _borderLineWidth / parentWidth, which is then used to adjust the position. So, if the parent is 100x100, then x and y would be 0.02 each. Depending on rotation, the adjustment is added or subtracted.

But in the test, I can set the parent dimensions to 100, so the translation would be 2/100 = 0.02, which is 2%. So, the left and top positions should be 2% more or less than the original position.

But in the test, I'm not setting the rotation, so it's defaulting to 0. So, the #getBaseTranslation would return [-x, -y], which is [-0.02, -0.02]. 

Wait, in the code, when rotation is 0, the default case returns [-x, -y]. So, when added to x and y, which are 0.5 (50% of 100), the new position would be 0.5 - 0.02 = 0.48, so 48% for left and top.

So, the expected left and top would be 48%. 

I'll set the parent dimensions to 100,100, and the initial x and y to 0.5. Then, after calling fixAndSetPosition, the left and top should be 48% each.

So, in the test, I'll create the editor, set its parentDimensions to [100,100], x and y to 0.5, and rotation to 0. Then, call fixAndSetPosition. After that, check if the div's left and top are '48.00%' each.

I should also ensure that the initialize method is called, which sets the _borderLineWidth. Since in the test environment, the CSS method might not be available, I'll set it manually to 2.

Putting it all together, the test will:

1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Create a PDF document and a page.
3. Set the _borderLineWidth to 2.
4. Create an AnnotationEditor instance.
5. Set parent dimensions, x, y, and rotation.
6. Call fixAndSetPosition.
7. Check the style properties.

I need to make sure that the test fails before the patch because without the patch, the _borderLineWidth isn't set, and the positions aren't adjusted. So, the test expects the left and top to be 48%, which would only happen after the patch is applied.

So, the test should correctly capture the change introduced by the patch.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor position based on border line width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");

  // Create a test PDF document
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();

  // Initialize the editor with a mock l10n
  await AnnotationEditor.initialize({});

  // Set the border line width for testing
  AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth = 2;

  // Create an editor instance
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor(page);

  // Set parent dimensions and initial position
  editor.parentDimensions = [100, 100];
  editor.x = 0.5;
  editor.y = 0.5;
  editor.rotation = 0;

  // Call the method to fix and set the position
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  // Verify the expected position adjustment
  const expectedLeft = "48.00%";
  const expectedTop = "48.00%";
  
  expect(editor.div.style.left).toBe(expectedLeft);
  expect(editor.div.style.top).toBe(expectedTop);
});

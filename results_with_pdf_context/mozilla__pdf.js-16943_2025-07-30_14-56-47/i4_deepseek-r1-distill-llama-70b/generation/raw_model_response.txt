Okay, so I need to write a test that checks if the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor changes correctly after the patch is applied. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the patch provided. It seems to modify the AnnotationEditor class, adding a static _borderLineWidth property and initializing it in the static initialize method. The fixAndSetPosition method is also updated to adjust the position based on this new property.

So, the issue is about the line and resizers' style around the selected editor. Before the patch, the line and resizers might not have the correct width or style, causing the test to fail. After the patch, they should have the correct style.

I need to create a test that checks the border line width. The test will create an instance of AnnotationEditor, initialize it with some l10n, and then check if the _borderLineWidth is correctly set.

Wait, the test needs to fail before the patch. So, before the patch, the _borderLineWidth might be incorrect or not set. After the patch, it should be correctly set based on the CSS variable.

So, the test will import the necessary classes, create an instance, and assert that the _borderLineWidth is the expected value.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the required modules, set up the editor, and then check the static property.

I should make sure that the test is self-contained and only relies on the provided imports. Also, since it's a Node.js environment, I'll use dynamic imports.

So, the test will look something like this: import the AnnotationEditor and ColorManager, initialize the editor, and then check if the _borderLineWidth is as expected.

I'll write the test to expect a specific value, say 2, which should be set by the patch. Before the patch, this value might not be set correctly, causing the test to fail.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should change the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor, ColorManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    parent: {},
    uiManager: {},
    id: "test-editor",
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    name: "test-editor"
  });
  
  // Initialize with l10n
  await editor.initialize({});
  
  expect(AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth).toBe(2);
});
```

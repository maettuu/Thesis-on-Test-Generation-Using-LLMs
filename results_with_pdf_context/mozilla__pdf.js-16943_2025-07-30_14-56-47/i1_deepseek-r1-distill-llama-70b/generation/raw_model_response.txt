Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor should change. The patch provided makes some changes to the editor.js, freetext.js, and ink.js files. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Looking at the patch, I see that in editor.js, a static variable _borderLineWidth is added. It's initialized in the static initialize method by reading a CSS variable --outline-width. Then, in the fixAndSetPosition method, the position is adjusted based on this border width. 

The test should verify that after applying the patch, the editor's position is correctly adjusted by the border width. So, before the patch, the position wasn't adjusted, and after, it is.

I'll create a test case where I create an editor, set its position, and check if the left and top styles include the border width adjustment. 

I'll need to import the necessary classes. Since the test is in unit/editor_spec.js, I'll use the existing import for CommandManager and add imports for AnnotationEditor and FreeTextEditor from their respective files.

In the test, I'll initialize the editor with specific dimensions and position. Then, I'll call fixAndSetPosition and check the style properties. 

I'll set up the page dimensions and set the border width to 2px. Then, create an instance of FreeTextEditor, set its x and y, and call fixAndSetPosition. After that, I'll check if the left and top styles are correctly calculated by including the border width adjustment.

So, the test will fail before the patch because the adjustment isn't applied, and after the patch, it will pass because the adjustment is correctly included.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor position based on border line width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/freetext.js");
  
  // Initialize the editor with a specific border line width
  AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth = 2;
  
  // Create a new editor instance with specific dimensions and position
  const editor = new FreeTextEditor({
    parent: {
      viewport: {
        rawDims: {
          pageWidth: 100,
          pageHeight: 100,
        }
      }
    },
    x: 10,
    y: 20,
    uiManager: new CommandManager(),
  });
  
  // Set up the expected position after adjustment
  const expectedLeft = 10 + (2 / 100);
  const expectedTop = 20 + (2 / 100);
  
  // Apply the position fix
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();
  
  // Verify the position is correctly adjusted
  assert.strictEqual(editor.div.style.left, `${(expectedLeft * 100).toFixed(2)}%`);
  assert.strictEqual(editor.div.style.top, `${(expectedTop * 100).toFixed(2)}%`);
});
```

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor were changed. The patch provided modifies the editor.js and other files to adjust the border line width and the positioning of the editor. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds a static variable _borderLineWidth in AnnotationEditor, initializes it in the static initialize method, and uses it in the #getBaseTranslation method to adjust the position of the editor. This probably affects how the editor is rendered and positioned, especially when selected.

My goal is to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. So I need to simulate the scenario where the editor's style and resizers are correctly applied after the patch.

I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll import the necessary classes like AnnotationEditor, FreeTextEditor, and InkEditor. I'll also need to create a mock DOM element to simulate the editor's parent.

In the test, I'll initialize the AnnotationEditor with some parameters, including a mock parent element. I'll set the _borderLineWidth to 2 pixels to simulate the new style. Then, I'll render the editor and check its style properties.

I'll expect that after the patch, the editor's border width is correctly set to 2px, and the position is adjusted based on the new translation logic. So I'll compare the computed style's border width and the position of the editor after rendering.

If the patch is correct, these values should match the expected ones, making the test pass. Without the patch, the border width might be incorrect, causing the test to fail.

I'll structure the test using Jest, creating mock elements, initializing the editor, and making assertions on the computed styles. This should cover the changes introduced by the patch.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor positioning and resizers with correct border width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/freetext.js");
  const { InkEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/ink.js");

  // Setup mock DOM elements
  const parent = {
    getNextId: () => "1",
    pageIndex: 0,
    viewport: {
      rotation: 0,
      parentDimensions: [100, 100],
    },
  };

  // Initialize editor with default parameters
  const editorParams = {
    parent,
    id: "test-editor",
    uiManager: {},
    x: 10,
    y: 20,
    color: "#000",
    fontSize: 12,
  };

  // Create editors for testing
  const textEditor = new FreeTextEditor(editorParams);
  const inkEditor = new InkEditor(editorParams);

  // Mock getComputedStyle to return specific values
  global.getComputedStyle = () => ({
    getPropertyValue: () => "2px",
  });

  // Initialize the editors
  AnnotationEditor.initialize({});
  FreeTextEditor.initialize({});
  InkEditor.initialize({});

  // Render the editors
  textEditor.render();
  inkEditor.render();

  // Check computed styles and positioning
  expect(global.getComputedStyle(textEditor.div).borderWidth).toBe("2px");
  expect(global.getComputedStyle(inkEditor.div).borderWidth).toBe("2px");
});
```

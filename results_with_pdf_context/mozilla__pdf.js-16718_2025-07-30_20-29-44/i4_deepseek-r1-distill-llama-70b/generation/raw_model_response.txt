Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the regression issue where PDF annotations aren't saved on certain PDFs is fixed. The patch provided makes some changes to the worker.js, writer.js, and xref.js files. 

First, I should understand the problem. The issue is that when saving a PDF with annotations, some files don't save them correctly. The patch modifies how XRef streams are handled, particularly ensuring that the linearization is considered when setting startXRef.

So, the test should open the provided bug1844572.pdf, add an annotation, save it, and then check if the annotation exists in the saved document. 

I'll use the getDocument function from the display/api.js module to load the PDF. Then, I'll create a new annotation and add it to the first page. After saving, I'll reload the document and check if the annotation is present.

I need to import the necessary modules dynamically to ensure compatibility. I'll structure the test with async/await for each step: loading the document, adding the annotation, saving, reloading, and checking.

I should handle any potential errors and ensure the test fails if the annotation isn't found after saving. This way, the test will pass only if the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should save annotations in certain PDFs", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams("bug1844572.pdf"));
  const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;

  const annotation = {
    type: "text",
    pages: [0],
    content: "Test annotation",
  };

  const firstPage = (await pdf.getPages([0])).shift();
  const annotations = await firstPage.getAnnotationsData();
  await firstPage.addAnnotation(annotation);

  const newDoc = await pdf.save();
  const reloadedPdf = await getDocument({
    ...buildGetDocumentParams("bug1844572.pdf"),
    data: newDoc,
  });

  const reloadedPages = await reloadedPdf.getPages([0]);
  const reloadedAnnotations = await reloadedPages.shift().getAnnotationsData();

  expect(reloadedAnnotations.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

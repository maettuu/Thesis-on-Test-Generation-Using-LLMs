Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF annotations aren't saved on certain PDFs. The patch provided is supposed to fix this, so my test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the patch details. It modifies worker.js, writer.js, and xref.js. The main changes seem to be around handling XRef streams and ensuring that the AcroForm dictionary isn't replaced if nothing changes. 

The test should check if annotations are correctly saved. So, I'll create a test that adds an annotation, saves the document, and then checks if the annotation exists in the saved version.

I'll use the provided PDF file, bug1844572.pdf. I'll import the necessary modules: getDocument from display/api.js and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js.

The test will follow these steps:
1. Load the PDF document.
2. Get the first page.
3. Create a new text annotation.
4. Add the annotation to the page.
5. Save the document with the annotations.
6. Load the saved document again.
7. Check if the annotation exists in the saved document.

I need to ensure that the test doesn't rely on any UI elements, just the core functionality. Also, since this is a regression test, it should be self-contained and not depend on external factors.

I'll structure the test using async/await for each step. I'll use Jest's it function with an async callback. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically to ensure compatibility with Node.js.

In the test, after adding the annotation, I'll call saveDocument to get the updated PDF bytes. Then, I'll load this new PDF and check the annotations on the first page. If the annotation exists, the test passes.

I should handle any potential errors, maybe with try-catch blocks, but since the test is expected to fail before the patch, I won't add error handling that might mask the issue.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's concise and only tests the specific issue.

```javascript
it("should save annotations on PDFs with certain structures", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1844572.pdf'));
  const { numPages, fingerprint } = await loadingTask.promise;

  const page = await loadingTask.doc.getPage(0);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotationsData();
  const newAnnotation = {
    type: 'text',
    content: 'Test Annotation',
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
  };

  await page.addAnnotation(newAnnotation);
  const updatedDoc = await loadingTask.doc.saveDocument();

  const loadedDoc = await getDocument({
    data: updatedDoc,
    password: null,
  });

  const loadedPage = await loadedDoc.getPage(0);
  const loadedAnnotations = await loadedPage.getAnnotationsData();

  expect(loadedAnnotations.length).toBe(annotations.length + 1);
});
```

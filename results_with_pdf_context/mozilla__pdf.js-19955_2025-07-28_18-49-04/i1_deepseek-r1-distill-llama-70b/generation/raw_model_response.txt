Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the PDF.js library fails to generate a text layer for a specific PDF, likely due to a font issue. The user provided a patch, and I have to ensure the test passes after the patch is applied but fails before.

First, I'll look at the problem details. The PDF in question is "issue19954.pdf". When opened, it doesn't create a text layer, which is expected because the PDF contains actual text. The errors point to issues with font loading, specifically "invalid font name".

The patch modifies the evaluator.js file. It seems to adjust how font descriptors are handled, especially for Type3 fonts. The key changes are around ensuring a valid font name is set even when the font descriptor is missing or incorrect.

So, the test should check if the text layer is generated correctly after the patch. The test will load the PDF and check for the presence of text items, which indicate a text layer.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I'll need getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Also, I'll import the required classes like Dict, Name, and OperatorList for any necessary setup.

Next, I'll set up the test using Jest's it function. I'll describe the expected behavior, which is that the text layer should be generated. 

Inside the test, I'll create a mock XRef using XRefMock. Then, I'll load the PDF document using getDocument with the parameters built from the test file. I'll wrap this in a promise to handle the asynchronous loading.

Once the document is loaded, I'll get the first page and render it. After rendering, I'll access the text items from the textLayer. If the text items exist, it means the text layer was successfully generated.

I'll then check if the text items array has content. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to ensure that this test fails before the patch is applied. Without the patch, the font issues would prevent the text layer from being created, so textItems would be empty. After applying the patch, the text layer should be generated, making textItems non-empty.

I should also handle any potential errors during loading or rendering, perhaps using try-catch blocks to catch and fail the test on any exceptions.

Finally, I'll structure the code within the it block, making sure to use async/await correctly and return the promise so that Jest can await the test's completion.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, ensuring all necessary imports and steps are included.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for PDF with missing font descriptor", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19954.pdf'));

  try {
    const { numPages } = await loadingTask;
    const page = await loadingTask.getPage(1);
    const textLayer = await page.getTextContent();
    const textItems = textLayer.items;

    expect(textItems.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to load or render PDF: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

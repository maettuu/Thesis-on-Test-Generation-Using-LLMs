Okay, I need to create a test that checks if the regression issue is fixed after applying the patch. The issue is that the PDF file 'issue19954.pdf' doesn't generate a text layer because of a font issue, but after the patch, it should work correctly.

First, I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll need to import the necessary modules, including the PartialEvaluator from the evaluator.js file. I'll also need to create a mock XRef to simulate the PDF document.

Next, I'll set up the evaluator with the required options, making sure that useSystemFonts is disabled to avoid relying on external fonts. Then, I'll create a mock font dictionary that represents the problematic font from the PDF.

I'll define the test using Jest's 'it' function. The test will be called 'should generate text layer for issue19954.pdf'. Inside the test, I'll use the getDocument function to load the PDF file. This will allow me to get the first page and extract the text content.

I'll wrap the text extraction in a promise to handle the asynchronous operations. If the extraction is successful and the text content isn't empty, the test will pass. If it fails, I'll catch the error and fail the test.

I need to ensure that the test correctly mocks the necessary dependencies and accurately represents the scenario where the font loading issue occurs. By using the provided PDF file and checking for non-empty text content, the test will validate whether the patch successfully fixes the issue.

Finally, I'll make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports without adding any new dependencies. This way, the test will run smoothly in the existing environment.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for issue19954.pdf", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: {
      send: () => {},
      sendWithPromise: () => Promise.resolve(),
    },
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: new Map(),
    builtInCMapCache: new Map(),
    standardFontDataCache: new Map(),
    globalColorSpaceCache: new Map(),
    globalImageCache: new Map(),
    systemFontCache: new Map(),
    options: {
      useSystemFonts: false,
    },
  });

  const fontDict = new Dict({
    Type: "Font",
    Subtype: "Type3",
    FontBBox: [0, 0, 0, 0],
    FontName: new Name("TestFont"),
  });

  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19954.pdf'));
  const doc = await loadingTask;
  const page = await doc.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent({
    disableNormalization: true,
  });

  expect(textContent.items.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

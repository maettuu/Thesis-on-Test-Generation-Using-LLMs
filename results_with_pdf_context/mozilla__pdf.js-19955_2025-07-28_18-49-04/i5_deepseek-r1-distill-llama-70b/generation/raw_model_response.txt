Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the PDF doesn't generate a text layer because of a broken font. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll use the provided PDF file, issue19954.pdf, since it's the one with the problem. I'll import getDocument from the API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils to load the PDF.

Next, I'll load the PDF and get the first page. Then, I'll create a TextLayer for that page. The TextLayer should have text, so I'll check if the text is present.

Before the patch, the text layer was missing, so the test would fail. After the patch, it should have text, making the test pass. I'll use a try-catch block to handle any errors during loading.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with an async function and use await for each step. 

So, the test will load the PDF, get the page, create the TextLayer, and check if the text is not empty. If it is, the test fails. This should correctly validate the fix.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for PDF with problematic font", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19954.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdf = await loadingTask;
    const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
    const textLayer = await new TextLayerBuilder().getTextLayer(page);
    
    expect(textLayer.text).not.toBe("");
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).not.toThrow();
  }
});
```

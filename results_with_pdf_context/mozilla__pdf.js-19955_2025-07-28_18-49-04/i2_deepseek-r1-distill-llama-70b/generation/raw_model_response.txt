Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF with a missing or broken font doesn't generate a text layer. The user provided a patch that's supposed to fix this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The PDF in question has a Type3 font without a proper FontDescriptor, causing the text layer not to render. The patch modifies the evaluator.js to handle such cases better.

The test should check if the text layer is generated correctly after the fix. So, I'll need to load the PDF, render the page, and check for the presence of text in the text layer.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules: getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. Then, I'll load the PDF file using these imports.

Next, I'll set up the PDF document and render the first page. After rendering, I'll check the text layer of the page. If the patch works, the text layer should have content, so I'll expect the text to not be empty.

I'll use async/await for loading the document and handling any potential errors. The test will fail if any step throws an error, indicating the patch didn't resolve the issue.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import the modules to maintain compatibility with Node.js.

Putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, render the page, and assert that the text layer has content. This should verify that the patch successfully fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for Type3 fonts with missing FontName", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19954.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
    const pageIndex = 0;
    const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(indexOfPage);
    const textLayer = await page.getTextContent();
    expect(textLayer.items.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Failed to load or render PDF with Type3 font issue");
  }
});
```

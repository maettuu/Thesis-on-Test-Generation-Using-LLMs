Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the regression issue is fixed. The issue is that the PDF wasn't generating a text layer because of a font issue, but after the patch, it should work.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. I'll use getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils to load the PDF.

I'll set up the test using Jest's it function. The test will be called "should generate text layer for issue19954.pdf".

Next, I'll initialize the loading task for the PDF file. Then, I'll get the first page and render it, ensuring the text layer is generated.

I'll create a new Promise to wait for the text layer to be ready. I'll use a setTimeout to allow time for the page to render and the text layer to be created.

Once the text layer is available, I'll check that it's not null and that it has items. If it does, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the code to dynamically import the necessary modules and handle the PDF loading correctly.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring it's concise and only tests the specific behavior without any extra fluff.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for issue19954.pdf", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19954.pdf'));

  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const textLayer = await page.getTextContent();
  const textLayerRendered = new Promise(resolve => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      const textLayer = page.getTextLayer();
      resolve(textLayer);
    }, 1000);
  });

  const result = await textLayerRendered;
  expect(result).not.toBeNull();
  expect(result.items).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the Voice Over reads highlighted text during editing in a PDF. The issue is that before the patch, it doesn't, and after the patch, it should. 

First, I should understand the changes made in the patch. Looking at the provided code, several files were modified. The key changes seem to be adding ARIA attributes to make the UI elements accessible. For example, in draw_layer.js, they added `svg.setAttribute("aria-hidden", true);` which hides the SVG from screen readers. In highlight.js, they added a `<mark>` element with `className="visuallyHidden"`, making the text invisible but readable by screen readers.

So, the test needs to verify that when a highlight is created, the text is correctly exposed to assistive technologies like Voice Over.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Create a sample PDF with some text.
2. Highlight a portion of the text.
3. Check if the highlighted text is accessible, i.e., the `<mark>` element exists and has the correct text.

I'll use Jest for testing and Puppeteer to simulate the browser environment. Puppeteer can check if the element exists and has the expected properties.

I'll import the necessary modules, set up a test server to serve the PDF, and then use Puppeteer to navigate to the page. After highlighting, I'll query the DOM to see if the `<mark>` element is present and contains the highlighted text.

So, the test will look like this: create a PDF page, highlight text, and then check for the presence of the visually hidden mark element with the correct text.

```javascript
it("should allow Voice Over to read highlighted text during editing", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/pdf_document.js");
  const { TextLayer } = await import("../../src/display/text_layer.js");
  const { DrawLayer } = await import("../../src/display/draw_layer.js");
  const { HighlightEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/highlight.js");

  // Set up a minimal test PDF
  const pdfBytes = new Uint8Array([0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46]);
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfBytes, { isEvalSupported: false });

  // Create a text layer with some content
  const text = "Hello World";
  const textLayer = new TextLayer();
  textLayer.setText(text);

  // Create a highlight editor
  const highlightEditor = new HighlightEditor({
    text: text,
    color: "#FFFF98",
    opacity: 1,
    thickness: 12,
    methodOfCreation: "main_toolbar",
  });

  // Render the highlight
  const highlightDiv = highlightEditor.render();

  // Check for the visually hidden mark element
  const markElement = highlightDiv.querySelector(".visuallyHidden");
  expect(markElement).toBeTruthy();
  expect(markElement.textContent).toBe(text);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where Voice Over doesn't read highlighted text during editing in a PDF. The patch provided makes several changes, so I should focus on what those changes do and how to test them effectively.

First, I'll look at the patch. It adds "aria-hidden" attributes to some elements and introduces a visually hidden "mark" element that contains the text. This suggests that the highlighted text is now being made accessible to screen readers while being visually hidden.

My test needs to ensure that before the patch, the text isn't accessible, and after, it is. So, I'll create a test PDF with a highlight and check if the text is read by assistive technologies.

I'll use the PDFPageProxy to get the page and the AnnotationEditor to create a highlight. Then, I'll simulate adding the highlight and check the rendered elements. I'll look for the "mark" element with the class "visuallyHidden" containing the text.

I'll also check that the highlight div has "aria-hidden" set to "true" to ensure it's not read, while the mark element is correctly added for screen readers.

So, the test will:
1. Create a PDF page with text.
2. Add a highlight annotation.
3. Render the page and check for the mark element.
4. Verify the text is present and the elements have the correct attributes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses only the provided imports. I'll structure it using Jest and dynamic imports to fit the Node.js environment.

```javascript
it("should read highlighted text for Voice Over when editing PDF", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPageProxy, AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  
  // Create a test PDF with a highlight annotation
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();
  const text = "Sample highlighted text";
  
  // Create and add a highlight annotation
  const annotation = new Annotation({
    type: Annotation.Type.HIGHLIGHT,
    text: text,
    quads: [],
    color: "#FF0000",
    opacity: 0.5
  });
  
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    annotation: annotation,
    page: page,
    render: () => {}
  });
  
  editor.render();
  
  // Check if the highlighted text is accessible
  const highlightDiv = editor.highlightDiv;
  const markElement = highlightDiv.querySelector("mark.visuallyHidden");
  
  expect(markElement).toBeTruthy();
  expect(markElement.textContent).toBe(text);
  expect(highlightDiv.getAttribute("aria-hidden")).toBe("true");
});
```

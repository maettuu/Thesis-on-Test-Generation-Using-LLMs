Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should throw an error when input is null", async () => {
  const { assert } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  let errorThrown = false;
  try {
    numberToString(null);
  } catch (error) {
    errorThrown = true;
    assert(error.message.includes("should be a number"));
  }
  assert(errorThrown, "Expected an error to be thrown for null input");
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/core_utils_spec.js` file before running it.

[2025-07-28 20:07:59] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should throw an error when null is passed to numberToString", async () => {
  const { numberToString } = await import("../../src/core/core_utils.js");
  let errorThrown = false;
  try {
    numberToString(null);
  } catch (error) {
    errorThrown = true;
  }
  expect(errorThrown).toBe(true);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/core_utils_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

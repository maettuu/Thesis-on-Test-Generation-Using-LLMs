Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the HTML Spec page printed to PDF can't be opened in Firefox. The patch provided is in xref.js, and I have to make sure the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The issue is related to how XRef entries are handled, specifically when the generation number (gen) doesn't match the index. The patch adjusts the gen number if it's mismatched, which should fix the PDF structure so that Firefox can open it.

Looking at the test file, I see it's using Jest or a similar testing framework. I'll need to write an 'it' block that tests this specific scenario.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. The test_utils.js has buildGetDocumentParams which I can use to load the PDF. Also, I'll need to import getDocument from the display API.

Next, I'll set up the test. I'll use the PDF file 'bug1978317.pdf' from the test_pdfs server. I'll create a promise for the document and another for any errors.

In the test, I'll try to get the document. If it succeeds, that's a failure because the bug should cause an error. If it catches an error, that means the test is passing, but since the patch should fix it, the test should now pass (i.e., not throw an error).

Wait, no. Before the patch, opening the PDF would throw an error, so the test should expect an error. After the patch, it shouldn't throw, so the test should pass without error.

So, the test should attempt to load the PDF and expect that it doesn't throw an InvalidPDFException or any other error. If the patch is correct, the test will pass.

I'll structure the test with a try-catch block. If an error is caught, the test fails. If no error, it passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses the correct imports. I'll use dynamic imports to get the necessary functions.

Putting it all together, the test will import the required modules, attempt to load the PDF, and check for any errors. If the PDF loads without issues, the test passes, indicating the patch works.

```javascript
it("should fix bug where HTML Spec PDF cannot be opened in Firefox", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('bug1978317.pdf'));
  
  try {
    const document = await loadingTask;
    await document.close();
    // If no exception is thrown, the PDF was loaded successfully
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("Failed to load PDF after applying patch");
    }
    throw error;
  }
});
```

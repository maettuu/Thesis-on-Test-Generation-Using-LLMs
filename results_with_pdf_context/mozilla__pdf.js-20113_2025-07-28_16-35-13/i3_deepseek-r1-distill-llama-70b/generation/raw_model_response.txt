Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where the HTML spec page printed to PDF can't be opened in Firefox. The patch provided is for the xref.js file, so the test should verify that the bug is fixed after applying this patch.

First, I should understand the problem. The user mentioned that the PDF can't be opened in Firefox, which suggests that there's an issue with how the PDF is structured, specifically in the cross-reference table. The patch modifies the xref.js file, adjusting how entries in the xref table are handled, especially when the generation number doesn't match the index.

So, the test needs to check if the PDF can be loaded correctly after the patch. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after.

Looking at the existing test file, I see that it imports necessary modules and sets up a TestPdfsServer. I can reuse these imports and setup in my test.

I'll write a test that attempts to load the bug1978317.pdf file. If the PDF can be loaded without errors, the test passes. Before the patch, this should throw an error, and after, it should load without issues.

I'll structure the test using the provided example. I'll import getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. Then, I'll set up the PDF file path and use getDocument to load it. If it loads successfully, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only tests the specific behavior. So, I'll wrap it in an async function and use try-catch to handle any exceptions during loading.

Finally, I'll return the test code without any extra comments or explanations, as per the instructions.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle xref table entries with mismatched generation numbers", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const pdfPath = buildGetDocumentParams('bug1978317.pdf');
  
  try {
    const loadingTask = getDocument(pdfPath);
    await loadingTask.promise;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Failed to load PDF: " + error.message);
  }
});
```

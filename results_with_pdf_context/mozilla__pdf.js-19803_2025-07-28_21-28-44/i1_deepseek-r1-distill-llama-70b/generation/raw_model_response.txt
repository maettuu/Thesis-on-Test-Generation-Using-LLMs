Okay, I need to write a test for the PDF.js library to ensure that the patch fixing circular references in Form XObjects works correctly. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The issue is that when a PDF contains circular references in Form XObjects, it causes an infinite loop, making the spinner spin forever. The patch is supposed to handle this by detecting such circular references and ignoring them, thus preventing the loop.

Looking at the provided code, the test file already has several imports, including Annotation, PartialEvaluator, and others. I can reuse these imports to set up the test.

I'll need to use the PDF file 'issue19800.pdf' which is provided. The test will load this PDF and attempt to render it. Before the patch, this should cause an infinite loop, but after the patch, it should render without issues.

I'll structure the test using Jest's 'it' function. The test will be named something like "should handle circular Form XObjects without infinite looping".

In the test, I'll import the necessary modules, including getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils. Then, I'll load the PDF document using getDocument with the appropriate parameters.

Next, I'll set up a Promise to wait for the document to load and for any potential errors. Since the issue causes an infinite loop, I'll use a timeout to fail the test if it doesn't complete in a reasonable time. However, with the patch, the document should load without issues, so I won't need the timeout after applying the patch.

I'll create a function to check if the document is loaded and handle any errors. If the document loads successfully, the test passes. If it times out or throws an error, the test fails.

Putting it all together, the test will attempt to load the PDF and wait for it to be parsed. If it succeeds, that means the circular references are handled correctly. If it fails or times out, it indicates the issue persists.

I'll make sure to return only the JavaScript code for the new test block without any extra comments or explanations, as per the instructions.

```javascript
it("should handle circular Form XObjects without infinite looping", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19800.pdf'));

  const documentLoaded = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    loadingTask.promise.then(
      (pdfDocument) => {
        resolve(pdfDocument);
      },
      (error) => {
        reject(error);
      }
    );
  });

  // The PDF should load without causing an infinite loop
  const result = await documentLoaded;
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
});
```

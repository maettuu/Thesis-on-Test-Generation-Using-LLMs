Okay, I need to write a test for the circular reference issue in Form XObjects. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll import the necessary modules. I'll use getDocument from the display API and buildGetDocumentParams from test_utils.js. 

Next, I'll load the problem PDF using getDocument with the correct parameters. 

I'll create a function to check if the PDF loading results in an error. Initially, without the patch, this should throw an error because of the circular references. After the patch, it should load without issues.

In the test, I'll use a try-catch block. If an error occurs during loading, I'll catch it and check if it's the expected error. Since the patch should prevent the spinner from spinning forever, the test expects the PDF to load without errors after the patch.

So, the test will attempt to load the document and check for any errors. If it loads successfully, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with async/await and use try-catch for error handling.

Finally, I'll write the test block, ensuring it's concise and directly addresses the issue.

```javascript
it("should not hang when loading PDF with circular Form XObjects", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue19800.pdf'));
  
  const loadResult = await loadingTask.promise;
  
  expect(loadResult.error).toBeUndefined();
});
```

[2025-07-28 21:40:16] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should handle circular references in Form XObjects without endless loop", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams("issue19800.pdf"));
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const pdfPage = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const operatorList = await pdfPage.getOperatorList();
  expect(operatorList).toBeDefined();
  expect(operatorList.fnArray.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/annotation_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

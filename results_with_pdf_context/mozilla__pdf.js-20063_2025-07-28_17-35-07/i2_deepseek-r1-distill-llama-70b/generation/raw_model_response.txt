Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the PolygonAnnotation's fill isn't rendered in PDF.js. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll use the provided PDF file, issue20062.pdf, which has a polygon with both stroke and fill. I'll need to open this PDF using PDF.js and check if the fill is rendered correctly.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test runs in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for getDocument and buildGetDocumentParams. 

Next, I'll load the document and get the first page. Once the page is loaded, I'll create a canvas element to draw the page. 

Now, I need to extract the polygon annotation from the page. I'll find the annotations and check each one to see if it's a PolygonAnnotation. Once found, I'll get its appearance and check if the fill is present.

I'll set up an event listener for when the page is rendered to the canvas. After rendering, I'll use the canvas context to get the pixel data. I'll check a specific point (e.g., the center) to see if the fill color is present. 

I'll compare the actual pixel values to the expected fill color. If they match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. Also, the test should be concise and directly test the fill rendering issue.

Finally, I'll structure the test as an async function using Jest's it syntax, making sure it returns only the JavaScript code without any extra comments.

```javascript
it("should render polygon annotation with fill color", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue20062.pdf'));
  
  const doc = await loadingTask.promise;
  const page = await doc.getPage(1);
  
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  let annotation;
  
  page.on('annotationloaded', (annotationArgs) => {
    if (annotationArgs.annotation instanceof PolygonAnnotation) {
      annotation = annotationArgs.annotation;
    }
  });
  
  const renderTask = page.render({
    canvasContext: context,
    viewport: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 })
  });
  
  const expectedFillColor = [0, 255, 0]; // Green fill color
  
  const fillResolve = new Promise(resolve => {
    renderTask.on('finish', () => {
      const pixelData = context.getImageData(
        canvas.width/2,
        canvas.height/2,
        1,
        1
      ).data;
      
      resolve(pixelData);
    });
  });
  
  const actualPixelData = await fillResolve;
  
  expect(actualPixelData).toEqual(expectedFillColor.concat([255]));
});
```

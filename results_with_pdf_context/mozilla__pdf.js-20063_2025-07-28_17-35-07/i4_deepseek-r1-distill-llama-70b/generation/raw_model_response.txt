Alright, I need to write a test that checks if the polygon annotation's fill is rendered correctly. The issue is that in PDF.js, the fill isn't showing, but it does in Acrobat and Edge. The patch provided modifies the code to handle the fill color, so the test should pass after applying the patch.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. I'll use `getDocument` from `../../src/display/api.js` and `buildGetDocumentParams` from `./test_utils.js` to load the PDF.

Next, I'll load the PDF document using these imports. I'll make sure to handle any potential errors.

Once the document is loaded, I'll get the first page and its annotations. I'm assuming the PDF has at least one page with the polygon annotation.

I'll extract the first annotation and check if it's a `PolygonAnnotation`. Then, I'll render it using `getOperatorList` with the display intent.

After rendering, I'll check the operator list for fill commands. Specifically, I'll look for the "f" operator which indicates a fill. If it's present, the test passes.

I need to ensure that the test fails without the patch and passes with it. The test is designed to be self-contained, so I won't add any comments or explanations beyond the code.

I also need to make sure that the test correctly imports the modules and handles asynchronous operations properly. The test should be concise and focused on verifying the fill rendering.

Finally, I'll structure the test as an `it` block with the correct description and assertions.

```javascript
it("should render polygon annotation with fill color", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue20062.pdf'));

  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(0);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();

  const annotation = annotations[0];
  const operatorList = await annotation.getOperatorList(null, null, RenderingIntentFlag.DISPLAY);

  const expectedFillOperator = "f";
  const actualOperators = operatorList.opList.ops.map(op => op.cmd);

  assert.ok(actualOperators.includes(expectedFillOperator));
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the PolygonAnnotation fill isn't rendered in PDF.js. The patch provided modifies the annotation.js file to handle the fill color correctly. 

First, I'll look at the existing test file, test/unit/annotation_spec.js, to see what's available. It imports necessary modules and sets up some test utilities. I can reuse these imports and structure my test similarly.

The test should check if the polygon is filled correctly. I'll need to load the specific PDF file, 'issue20062.pdf', which has the problematic polygon. Using the PDF.js display API, I'll render the PDF page and check the rendered canvas for the fill color.

I'll use the getDocument function from the display API to load the PDF. Once loaded, I'll get the first page and render it. After rendering, I'll extract the canvas and check the pixel colors. 

I'll define the expected fill color from the PDF. Then, I'll get the actual color from the canvas at the center of the polygon. If the patch is correct, the colors should match.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll include all necessary imports within the test block. I'll use async/await for loading the PDF and rendering the page.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest's it function, including the setup, rendering, and color comparison. This should ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after.

```javascript
it("should render polygon annotation with fill color", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import('../../src/display/api.js');
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import('./test_utils.js');
  const loadingTask = getDocument(buildGetDocumentParams('issue20062.pdf'));

  const expectedFillColor = [0, 255, 0]; // Green fill color from the PDF

  const { numPages, pageRendering } = await loadingTask;
  const page = await pageRendering(0);
  await page.render({ canvasContext: { canvas: document.createElement('canvas') } });

  const canvas = page.canvas;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  const imageData = ctx.getImageData(
    canvas.width / 2,
    canvas.height / 2,
    1,
    1
  );
  const actualFillColor = [
    imageData.data[0],
    imageData.data[1],
    imageData.data[2]
  ];

  expect(actualFillColor).toEqual(expectedFillColor);
});
```

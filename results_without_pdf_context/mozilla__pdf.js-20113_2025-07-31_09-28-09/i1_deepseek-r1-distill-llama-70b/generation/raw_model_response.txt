Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where printing an HTML spec page to PDF can't be opened in Firefox. The patch provided modifies the xref.js file, specifically the fetchCompressed method. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The patch adds code that adjusts the generation number (gen) for xref entries if the index doesn't match. This probably fixes a bug where the xref table wasn't correctly handling cases where the generation number and index were different, leading to invalid PDF structures.

To test this, I need a PDF that triggers the bug. The HTML spec is a good candidate because it's known to cause the issue. I'll use the test_pdfs server to serve this file.

The test should check if the PDF can be loaded without errors. Before the patch, loading the PDF would throw an exception. After the patch, it should load correctly.

I'll structure the test using the existing setup in the test file. I'll import necessary modules like TestPdfsServer and getDocument. I'll start the server, fetch the HTML spec PDF, and try to load it. If it doesn't throw an error, the test passes.

I'll write an async test block that initializes the server, fetches the PDF, and uses getDocument to load it. I'll wrap this in a try-catch block. If an error occurs, the test fails; otherwise, it passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only tests the specific behavior. I'll use the provided imports and structure the test to fit into the existing test suite.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle HTML spec PDFs when printed to PDF", async () => {
  const { TestPdfsServer } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");

  const server = new TestPdfsServer();
  try {
    await server.start();
    const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/html-spec.pdf`;
    const loadingTask = await getDocument({
      url: server.url + pdfPath,
      transport: new PDFDataRangeTransport(),
    });
    const document = await loadingTask.document;
    // If we don't get an exception, the test passes (since previously it would fail)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("PDF is invalid even after the fix");
    }
  } finally {
    await server.stop();
  }
});
```

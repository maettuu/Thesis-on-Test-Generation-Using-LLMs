Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where printing an HTML spec page to PDF can't be opened in Firefox. The patch provided is in xref.js, and I need to ensure the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The user mentioned that the PDF generated from the HTML spec page can't be opened in Firefox. This suggests there's an issue with how the PDF is structured, possibly related to cross-reference tables or object streams.

Looking at the patch, it's in xref.js. The code adds a check to fix the generation number in the xref table. It seems that when the index (generation number) doesn't match the entry's index, it corrects it. This probably prevents circular references or incorrect object linking.

To write the test, I need to simulate the scenario. The test should create a PDF with an XRef issue before the patch and ensure it fails, then pass after the patch.

I'll use the test_utils.js to get the test PDFs. I'll create a test PDF that triggers the issue. Then, I'll load it with pdf.js and check if it can be read correctly.

The test structure should import the necessary modules, create the PDF, and then try to load it. If it throws an error before the patch, that's the failure. After the patch, it should load without issues.

I'll use Jest's it function with an async arrow function. I'll import XRef and other necessary modules. Then, I'll create a test PDF, maybe using a simple structure that replicates the issue.

In the test, I'll try to load the PDF. Before the patch, it should throw an InvalidPDFException. After the patch, it should load the PDF correctly, allowing me to access the root dictionary.

So, the test will have two parts: one that expects failure without the patch and one that expects success with the patch. But since the test runs after the patch, I'll structure it to ensure that the correct behavior is verified.

I'll set up the test to create an XRef instance, parse the test PDF, and then check if the root is accessible. If it is, the test passes.

I need to make sure all imports are correct and that the test is self-contained without external dependencies beyond what's provided.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring it's concise and only tests the specific regression.

```javascript
it("should fix XRef generation issue when printing HTML spec", async () => {
  const { XRef } = await import("../../src/core/xref.js");
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { TestPdfsServer } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  
  const server = new TestPdfsServer();
  try {
    const pdf = server.getTestPdf("issue_1978317.pdf");
    const xref = new XRef(pdf.stream, pdf.manager);
    await xref.parse();
    const root = await xref.getCatalogObj();
    expect(root).toBeTruthy();
  } finally {
    server.stop();
  }
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the HTML spec page printed to PDF can't be opened in Firefox. The patch provided is for the xref.js file, specifically modifying the fetchCompressed method. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch is fixing an issue in the xref table where the generation number (gen) wasn't correctly set for xref entries. This caused problems when trying to access certain objects in the PDF, leading to errors when opening in Firefox.

So, the test needs to verify that after applying the patch, the xref entries are correctly handled. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll start by creating a test case that loads a PDF where the xref table has entries with mismatched gen numbers. Before the patch, this would cause an error, but after the patch, it should be fixed.

I'll need to import the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports. I'll import XRef from '../../src/core/xref.js' and Ref from '../../src/core/primitives.js'. Also, I'll need a sample PDF that triggers the issue. For this, I'll assume there's a test PDF in './test.pdf'.

In the test, I'll create a new XRef instance with a mock stream and pdfManager. Then, I'll set up a Ref to the problematic object in the PDF. I'll attempt to fetch this reference using xref.fetchCompressed. 

Before the patch, this should throw an XRefEntryException because the gen number doesn't match. After the patch, the same code should correctly fetch the object without errors.

I'll structure the test using async/await since the fetchCompressed method is asynchronous. I'll wrap the test in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions and assert that no error is thrown after the patch.

Finally, I'll write the test as an Mocha it block, ensuring it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle xref entries with mismatched generation numbers", async () => {
  const { XRef } = await import("../../src/core/xref.js");
  const { Ref } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");
  
  // Create a mock stream and pdfManager for testing
  const stream = {
    makeSubStream: () => ({ start: 0, end: 0 }),
    dict: { First: 0, N: 1 }
  };
  const pdfManager = { getStdFont: async () => null };
  
  const xref = new XRef(stream, pdfManager);
  const ref = Ref.get(1, 0);
  
  try {
    await xref.fetchCompressed(ref, { offset: 0, gen: 0 });
    assert(true, "Expected XRefEntryException to be thrown but wasn't");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof XRefEntryException) {
      assert(true, "Correctly throws XRefEntryException for mismatched gen");
    } else {
      assert(false, `Unexpected error: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
});
```

[2025-08-01 05:13:57] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for JPEG images when supported", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { shadow } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  const mockStream = {
    getBytes: () => new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0, 0x00, 0x10]),
    dict: {
      getArray: () => null,
    },
    isAsync: false,
  };

  const jpegStream = new JpegStream(mockStream, null, null);
  const canUseImageDecoder = await JpegStream.canUseImageDecoder;
  const transferableImage = await jpegStream.getTransferableImage();

  if (canUseImageDecoder) {
    expect(transferableImage).not.toBeNull();
  } else {
    expect(transferableImage).toBeNull();
  }
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/primitives_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

[2025-08-01 05:29:00] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for faster image decoding", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");

  // Create a sample JPEG stream with data that can be decoded with ImageDecoder
  const jpegData = new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xd8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]);
  const stream = new JpegStream({
    stream: { getBytes: () => Promise.resolve(jpegData) },
    params: {}
  });

  // Check if ImageDecoder is supported
  const canUseImageDecoder = await JpegStream.canUseImageDecoder;

  // Verify the expected behavior based on ImageDecoder support
  const bitmap = await stream.getTransferableImage();

  if (canUseImageDecoder) {
    expect(bitmap).toBeTruthy();
  } else {
    expect(bitmap).toBeNull();
  }
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/primitives_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

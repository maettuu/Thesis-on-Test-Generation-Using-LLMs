Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where ImageDecoder is used to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main changes are in jpeg_stream.js and jpg.js. The JpegStream class now has a getTransferableImage method that uses ImageDecoder. The JpegImage class has a canUseImageDecoder method that checks if the image can be decoded with ImageDecoder.

So, the test should verify that when ImageDecoder is available and supported, the image uses it, otherwise, it falls back to the old method.

I'll structure the test to create a JpegStream instance with sample JPEG data. Then, I'll check if getTransferableImage returns a bitmap when ImageDecoder is supported. If it does, the test passes. If not, it should return null.

I'll use a sample JPEG data, maybe a small image. I'll import the necessary modules like JpegStream and JpegImage. Then, I'll create a JpegStream instance and call getTransferableImage. 

I need to handle cases where ImageDecoder isn't supported, so I'll use a try-catch block. If it's supported, the bitmap should be present. 

I'll write the test using Jest syntax, making sure it's async and properly imports the required modules. The test will fail before the patch because getTransferableImage isn't implemented, so it returns null. After the patch, it should return a bitmap, making the test pass.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, only using the provided imports, and doesn't add new dependencies. 

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring it's concise and only includes the test block as required.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for faster image decoding", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  
  // Create a sample JPEG stream with data that can be decoded with ImageDecoder
  const jpegData = new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xd8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]);
  const stream = new JpegStream({
    stream: { getBytes: () => Promise.resolve(jpegData) },
    params: {}
  });

  // Check if ImageDecoder is supported
  const canUseImageDecoder = await JpegStream.canUseImageDecoder;
  
  // Verify the expected behavior based on ImageDecoder support
  const bitmap = await stream.getTransferableImage();
  
  if (canUseImageDecoder) {
    expect(bitmap).toBeTruthy();
  } else {
    expect(bitmap).toBeNull();
  }
});

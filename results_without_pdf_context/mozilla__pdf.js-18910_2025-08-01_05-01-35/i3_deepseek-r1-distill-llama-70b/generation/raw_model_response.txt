Okay, I need to create a test for the patch that uses ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The patch was applied to several files, but the main changes are in jpeg_stream.js and image.js. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It seems like the patch introduces a new method getTransferableImage in the BaseStream class, which is implemented in JpegStream. This method uses the ImageDecoder API to decode images more efficiently. 

The test should check if this new method is correctly used and if it improves performance. Since it's a regression test, it should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll start by looking at the existing test file, primitives_spec.js. It imports some primitives and a StringStream, and uses XRefMock. I'll need to import the necessary modules for this test, like JpegStream, PDFImage, and maybe others.

The test should create a scenario where a JPEG image is decoded. Before the patch, the old method was used, which was slower. After the patch, the new method using ImageDecoder should be used, making the test pass.

I'll create a test that checks if the image is decoded using the new method. I'll mock the data and the XRef to simulate a PDF with a JPEG image. Then, I'll check if the getTransferableImage method is called and if the image is correctly decoded.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained. I'll import the necessary modules and set up the mocks. The test will async/await for the decoding to complete and then compare the expected and actual results.

So, the test will:

1. Import the required modules.
2. Set up a mock XRef and create a sample JPEG data stream.
3. Create a JpegStream instance and a PDFImage instance.
4. Check if the getTransferableImage method is available and used.
5. Verify that the image data is correctly decoded.

This way, the test will ensure that the patch correctly implements the ImageDecoder usage and improves decoding speed.

Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the patch for using ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds a method getTransferableImage to JpegStream which uses ImageDecoder when available. This should improve performance by avoiding intermediate ArrayBuffers.

So, the test should measure the time it takes to decode an image with and without the patch. But since I can't run benchmarks in a test, maybe I can check if the method is used correctly.

I'll create a test that loads a JPEG image and checks if getTransferableImage returns a bitmap. Before the patch, this method didn't exist, so it would return null. After the patch, it should return a valid bitmap.

I'll use a sample JPEG image, maybe from a URL. I'll set up a test server or use a base64 encoded image for simplicity.

In the test, I'll create a JpegStream instance, call getTransferableImage, and assert that it's not null after the patch.

I need to import the necessary modules like JpegStream and ImageDecoder. Wait, ImageDecoder is a web API, so I might need to use a browser environment or a library that provides it.

But since the test is in Node.js, I might have to mock ImageDecoder or use a package that implements it. Alternatively, I can use a headless browser like Puppeteer.

Hmm, maybe using a base64 encoded image would be easier. I can create a buffer and pass it to JpegStream.

So the steps are:
1. Import JpegStream and other necessary modules.
2. Create a sample JPEG buffer.
3. Initialize JpegStream with the buffer.
4. Call getTransferableImage and check if it returns a bitmap.

Wait, in Node.js, ImageDecoder might not be available, so I might need to use a polyfill or mock it. Alternatively, I can check if the method exists and returns a non-null value, indicating that the patch is correctly using the new logic.

Alternatively, I can test that when ImageDecoder is supported, the getTransferableImage method returns a bitmap, and when it's not, it returns null.

But for the test, I just need to ensure that after the patch, the method returns a valid bitmap when possible.

So, I'll write a test that initializes a JpegStream with a sample image and checks that getTransferableImage returns a bitmap.

I'll use a small JPEG image encoded in base64 for testing. Then, I'll create a JpegStream instance, call getTransferableImage, and assert that it's not null.

I also need to handle any dependencies, like the base_stream module.

So, the test will import the required modules, set up the data, and perform the check.

  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");

  const buffer = Buffer.from(jpegData.split(',')[1], 'base64');

  class MockStream extends BaseStream {
    get bytes() {
      return this.buffer;
    }
  }

  const stream = new MockStream();
  stream.buffer = buffer;

  const jpegStream = new JpegStream(stream, null, {});

  // Check if getTransferableImage is implemented and returns a bitmap
  const image = await jpegStream.getTransferableImage();

  expect(image).not.toBeNull();

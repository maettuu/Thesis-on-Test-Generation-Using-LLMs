Okay, I need to create a regression test for the patch that uses ImageDecoder to speed up decoding images in PDFs. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main modifications are in jpeg_stream.js and image.js. The JpegStream class now has a getTransferableImage method that uses ImageDecoder. The PDFImage class also has a new #getImage method that tries to get a transferable image.

The goal is to test whether using ImageDecoder actually speeds up the decoding. So, the test should check if the image is decoded using the new method.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I need JpegStream from jpeg_stream.js and PDFImage from image.js. Also, I'll need a sample JPEG file to test with. I'll create an async function to load the image data.

In the test, I'll set up a mock XRef and create a JpegStream instance. Then, I'll create a PDFImage using this stream. I'll call getImageBytes on the PDFImage to trigger the decoding process.

The key part is checking if the image was decoded using the ImageDecoder. I'll look for a property or a method that indicates this. In the patch, the getTransferableImage method returns a bitmap if successful. So, after decoding, I'll check if the image's bitmap property exists, which would mean ImageDecoder was used.

If the bitmap is present, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. This way, the test ensures that the new decoding method is being utilized.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll structure the test with an async IIFE to handle the imports and setup properly.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest's it function, ensuring it's concise and only tests the specific behavior introduced by the patch.

```javascript
it("should use ImageDecoder for image decoding", async () => {
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");
  const { PDFImage } = await import("../../src/core/image.js");
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const imageStream = new JpegStream(
    new StringStream(new Uint8Array()),
    null,
    null
  );
  
  const image = new PDFImage({
    xref,
    res: null,
    image: imageStream,
    isInline: false,
    smask: null,
    mask: null,
    isMask: false,
    pdfFunctionFactory: null,
    localColorSpaceCache: null,
  });

  await image.getImageBytes(0, {});

  expect(image.bitmap).toBeDefined();
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the code scanning alerts were triggered due to unused debugging code in the pdf.js project. The patch removes the obsolete files `cffStandardStrings.js` and `fonts_utils.js`, so the test should ensure that these files are no longer used and that their removal doesn't break existing functionality.

First, I should figure out what these files were used for. From the code, it looks like they were part of a Type2 parser used for debugging. Since they're not imported anywhere else, their removal shouldn't affect the main codebase.

I need to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check that the files are not present or that their removal doesn't cause any issues.

Since the test needs to be self-contained and use only provided imports, I should use relative imports as specified. I'll structure the test using Jest syntax, as that's what's commonly used in such projects.

I'll create a test that tries to import the removed files. If the files are present, the import should fail, indicating that the patch hasn't been applied correctly. But wait, actually, the test should pass after the patch because the files are removed, so the import should throw an error.

Wait, no. The test should fail before the patch because the files are present but unused, causing the alerts. After the patch, the files are removed, so the test should pass because the code is clean.

Hmm, perhaps the test should check that the main functionality still works despite the removal. Alternatively, the test could check that the files are no longer present.

But since the test is about regression, it's better to ensure that the removal doesn't break any existing features. So, I'll test a scenario that would have used the Type2 parser before and ensure it still works after the patch.

Wait, but the Type2 parser was only for debugging and not used in production. So, perhaps the test can simply check that the files are no longer imported or that certain variables are undefined.

Alternatively, since the files are removed, any references to them should no longer exist. So, I can try to import them and expect an error, which would mean they're not present.

But in the context of the project, after the patch, those files are deleted, so importing them should throw an error. Before the patch, the files were present but unused, so the test would fail because the import would succeed, but the code is considered dead.

Wait, but the test is supposed to fail before the patch and pass after. So, perhaps the test should check that after the patch, the code doesn't have these files, so trying to use them would fail.

But how to structure that. Maybe the test can try to import the files and expect that they are not present.

So, in the test, I'll try to import `../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js` and expect that it throws an error because the file is no longer there. Before the patch, the import would succeed, causing the test to fail. After the patch, the import would fail, so the test would pass.

Wait, no. The test should fail before the patch because the files are present and causing issues, and pass after the patch because they're removed.

So, the test would be: before the patch, importing the files would not throw an error, which is bad because they should not be present. After the patch, importing them should throw an error, which is good.

But how to structure that in a test. Maybe the test is checking that certain modules are not present. So, in the test, I'll try to import the files and expect that they are not found.

Wait, perhaps the test should check that the Type2Parser is no longer present. But that might be more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can check that the code doesn't have any references to the removed variables. But that's harder to test.

Another approach is to test that the removal of the files doesn't break any existing functionality. For example, test that a font can still be parsed correctly. But that might be more complex.

But the problem is that the test needs to be self-contained and only use the provided imports. So, perhaps the simplest way is to try to import the removed files and expect that they are not found, which would indicate that the patch has been applied correctly.

So, in the test, I'll use dynamic imports to try to load `../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js` and expect it to throw an error. If the import is successful, the test fails because the file shouldn't be there anymore.

Wait, but in the patch, the files are removed, so after the patch, the import should throw an error. Therefore, the test should expect that the import throws an error, which would mean the patch is applied.

So, the test would look like this:

it("should not have unused debugging code", async () => {
  const fontsUtilsPath = "../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js";
  const cffStandardStringsPath = "../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js";
  
  // Try to import the removed files
  const importFontsUtils = async () => {
    await import(fontsUtilsPath);
  };
  
  const importCffStandardStrings = async () => {
    await import(cffStandardStringsPath);
  };
  
  // After the patch, these imports should throw errors
  await expect(importFontsUtils()).rejects.toThrow(Error);
  await expect(importCffStandardStrings()).rejects.toThrow(Error);
});

This way, before the patch, the import would succeed, causing the test to fail. After the patch, the import would throw an error, making the test pass.

I think this approach meets the requirements: it's a single test block, uses dynamic imports, is self-contained, and checks for the absence of the removed files.

```javascript
it("should not have unused debugging code", async () => {
  const fontsUtilsPath = "../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js";
  const cffStandardStringsPath = "../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js";
  
  // Try to import the removed files
  const importFontsUtils = async () => {
    await import(fontsUtilsPath);
  };
  
  const importCffStandardStrings = async () => {
    await import(cffStandardStringsPath);
  };
  
  // After the patch, these imports should throw errors
  await expect(importFontsUtils()).rejects.toThrow(Error);
  await expect(importCffStandardStrings()).rejects.toThrow(Error);
});
```

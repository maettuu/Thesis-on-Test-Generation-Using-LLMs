Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where some code scanning alerts appeared in the pdf.js repository. The patch provided removes two JavaScript files: cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js. The user wants a test that fails before the patch and passes after, ensuring the problematic code is no longer present.

First, I should understand what these files do. From the code, cffStandardStrings.js defines some mappings used for CFF font processing, and fonts_utils.js contains functions for parsing font data. The patch deletes these files, so the test needs to check that the code relying on them is removed.

The test should try to import these files and expect an error since they're no longer available. If the import fails, the test passes, indicating the files are gone.

Looking at the provided test file, it's a unit test for crypto functions. I can add a new test case here. I'll use async/await to dynamically import the files. If the import succeeds, the test should fail because the files should have been removed. If it throws an error, the test passes.

So, the test will attempt to import both files. If either import doesn't throw an error, the test fails. This ensures that after the patch, these files are indeed removed, resolving the alerts.

```javascript
it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { CFFEncodingMap } = await import("../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js");
  const { readCharset } = await import("../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js");
  
  // If we reach here, the files were not removed and the test should fail
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

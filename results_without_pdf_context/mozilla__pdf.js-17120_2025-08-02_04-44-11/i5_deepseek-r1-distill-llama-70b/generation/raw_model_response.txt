Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where new code scanning alerts appeared. The patch provided removes two files: cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since the patch removes these files, the test should check if the code still works without them. I'll import CFFParser from cff_parser.js because it's used in the test.

The test function is an async function. Inside, I'll create a sample CFF content using the string module. Then, I'll initialize a CFFParser with this content and try to parse it.

If the code before the patch is present, the parser would throw an error because those files are missing. But after the patch, the parser should work correctly because the unused code is removed.

I'll use a try-catch block. If parsing throws an error, the test fails. If it doesn't, it passes. So, in the test, I'll expect that parsing doesn't throw an error.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, making sure to return only the JavaScript code without any comments.

```javascript
it("should handle removal of unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { CFFParser } = await import("../../src/core/cff_parser.js");
  const sampleCFFContent = new TextEncoder().encode("%!PS-Adobe-Font-1.0:0\n");

  const parser = new CFFParser();
  const initializePromise = parser.initialize(sampleCFFContent);

  await expect(initializePromise).resolves.not.toThrow();
});
```

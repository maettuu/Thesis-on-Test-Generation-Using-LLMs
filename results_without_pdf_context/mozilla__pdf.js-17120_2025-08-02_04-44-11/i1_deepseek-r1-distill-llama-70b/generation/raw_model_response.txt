Okay, I need to create a regression test for the patch that removes the unused debugging code in the CFF files. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should look at what the patch does. It deletes two files: cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js. These files contain variables like CFFEncodingMap, CFFDictDataMap, and functions like readCharset, readCharstringEncoding, etc. The note says this is debugging code not called anywhere, so removing it shouldn't affect functionality.

The test needs to check that after the patch, the code doesn't have these unused variables and functions. But how? Maybe check that the variables are no longer present.

I can write a test that tries to access one of the removed variables. Before the patch, it should be present, so the test would fail if it's missing. After the patch, accessing it should throw an error, so the test should pass because the patch correctly removes it.

Wait, no. The test should fail before the patch because the variables exist, and pass after because they don't. Wait, no, regression tests usually check that a bug is fixed. So in this case, the presence of the variables is considered a bug (since they're unused and cause scanning alerts). So the test should check that after the patch, the variables are gone.

But how to structure that. The test can try to import the variables and see if they're undefined or if accessing them throws an error.

So, in the test, I'll import the module and check if CFFEncodingMap is undefined. If it is, the test passes because the patch removed it. If it's defined, the test fails because the patch didn't work.

So, the test would look like this: import the cffStandardStrings.js module and check if CFFEncodingMap is undefined. If it is, the test passes; else, it fails.

I should use async/await for the import since it's a JavaScript module. Then, in the test block, I'll use expect to check that CFFEncodingMap is undefined.

I need to make sure that the test correctly imports the module. Since the test is in a different directory, the import path should be correct. Also, I should handle any potential errors, but in this case, if the module isn't found, the test should fail, indicating the patch didn't remove it.

Putting it all together, the test will import the module and assert that CFFEncodingMap is not defined, which would mean the patch successfully removed the unused code.

it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { CFFEncodingMap } = await import("../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js");
  expect(CFFEncodingMap).toBeUndefined();
});

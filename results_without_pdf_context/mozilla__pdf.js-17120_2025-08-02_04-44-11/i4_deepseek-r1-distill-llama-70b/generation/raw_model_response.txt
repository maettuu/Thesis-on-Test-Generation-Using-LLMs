Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some debugging code in pdf.js was causing security alerts. The patch removes two files, cffStandardStrings.js and fonts_utils.js, which were part of the debugging code. 

First, I should understand what these files were doing. They were used for Type2 font parsing, which isn't directly used in production. Since they're not called elsewhere, removing them shouldn't affect the main functionality. 

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that checks if these files are present. If they are, the test fails because the code is still there. After the patch, the files are gone, so the test passes.

I'll use dynamic imports to check if the files can be loaded. If importing them doesn't throw an error, that means they exist, and the test fails. After the patch, importing should throw because the files are removed.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it block. I'll async/await the import statements and use try-catch to handle the errors. The test expects that after the patch, the imports throw ModuleNotFoundError.

So, the test tries to import the two files. If both fail, the test passes. If either succeeds, it fails. This ensures that the patch correctly removes the problematic code.

```javascript
it("should remove unused CFF debugging code", async () => {
  const { CFFEncodingMap } = await import("../../src/shared/cffStandardStrings.js");
  const { readCharset } = await import("../../src/shared/fonts_utils.js");

  // Test passes when the above imports throw ModuleNotFoundError
  expect(CFFEncodingMap).toBeUndefined();
  expect(readCharset).toBeUndefined();
});
```

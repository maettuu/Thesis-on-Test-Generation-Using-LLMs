Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the top and bottom images aren't displayed in the PDF file. The patch provided is supposed to fix this by correctly handling the SMask and Mask entries in the image dictionary. 

First, I should understand the problem. The issue arises when an image has its own soft-mask (via SMask or Mask), which should override the current graphics state's mask. Before the patch, these masks weren't being handled properly, causing the images not to display correctly.

Looking at the patch, it modifies the evaluator.js and operator_list.js files. The key changes are in the addImageOps method, where hasMask is now considered. If hasMask is true, it adds save and setGState operations before painting the image and restores the state afterward.

So, the test needs to verify that when an image has an SMask or Mask, the correct operations are added to the operator list. Specifically, it should check that save, setGState, paintImageXObject, and restore operations are present in the correct order.

I'll create a test that generates a PDF with an image that has an SMask. Then, it will process this PDF and check the operator list for the expected operations. Before the patch, the save and restore operations might not be present, causing the test to fail. After the patch, these operations should be added, making the test pass.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Create a sample PDF with an image that includes an SMask.
2. Use the PDFDocument and PartialEvaluator to process the PDF.
3. Check the operator list for the presence of save, setGState, paintImageXObject, and restore operations in the correct sequence.

I need to ensure that the test is self-contained and uses only the provided imports. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically for compatibility with Node.js.

Now, I'll write the test code. It will create an SMask image, process it, and then verify the operator list has the expected operations. This should fail before the patch and pass after.

Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where the top and bottom images are not displayed in the PDF file. The patch provided modifies the evaluator.js and operator_list.js files. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Looking at the patch, it seems to add handling for images with masks. In evaluator.js, the addImageOps function is called with an additional hasMask parameter. In operator_list.js, the addImageOps method now checks if hasMask is true and wraps the image operations with save, setGState, and restore operations.

So, the problem before the patch was that images with masks (like SMask or Mask) weren't being displayed correctly. The patch adds the necessary operations to handle these masks.

To test this, I'll create a test case that includes a PDF with such images. The test should check if the generated operator list correctly includes the save, setGState, and restore operations when a mask is present.

I'll set up a mock PDF with an image XObject that has an SMask. Then, I'll use the PartialEvaluator to process this XObject and check the generated OperatorList. 

I'll need to import the necessary modules, create a mock XRef, and define the image dictionary with the SMask entry. Then, I'll call buildPaintImageXObject and check if the operatorList has the expected operations.

The expected operations should include save, setGState with SMask, paintImageXObject, and restore. I'll use Jest's toMatchSnapshot() to compare the actual operatorList with the expected structure.

This test should fail before the patch because the mask handling wasn't present, and the operatorList wouldn't include the save and restore operations. After the patch, the test should pass as the correct operations are added.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle images with SMask", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator, OperatorList, Dict, Name } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const imageDict = new Dict();
  imageDict.set("Subtype", new Name("Image"));
  imageDict.set("W", 10);
  imageDict.set("H", 10);
  imageDict.set("SMask", new Name("Mask"));
  
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: {},
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: new Map(),
    builtInCMapCache: new Map(),
    standardFontDataCache: new Map(),
    globalImageCache: new Map(),
    systemFontCache: new Map(),
  });

  const operatorList = new OperatorList();
  const cacheKey = "test-image";
  const localImageCache = new Map();

  await evaluator.buildPaintImageXObject({
    resources: new Dict(),
    image: new Stream(new StringStream("")),
    isInline: false,
    operatorList,
    cacheKey,
    localImageCache,
    localColorSpaceCache: new Map(),
  });

  const expectedOperations = [
    { fn: OPS.save, args: [] },
    { fn: OPS.setGState, args: [[["SMask", false]]] },
    { fn: OPS.paintImageXObject, args: [expect.any(String), 10, 10] },
    { fn: OPS.restore, args: [] },
  ];

  expect(operatorList.fnArray).toContain(OPS.save);
  expect(operatorList.fnArray).toContain(OPS.setGState);
  expect(operatorList.fnArray).toContain(OPS.paintImageXObject);
  expect(operatorList.fnArray).toContain(OPS.restore);

  expect(operatorList).toMatchSnapshot();
});

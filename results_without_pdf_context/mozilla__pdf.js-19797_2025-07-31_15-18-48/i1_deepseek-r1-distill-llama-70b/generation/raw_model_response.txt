Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where a TypeError occurs when using annotations on a PDF in Safari on iOS. The error is "null is not an object (evaluating 'this.#touchMoveAC.abort')". 

First, I'll look at the provided patch to understand the changes made. The patch modifies two files: tools.js and touch_manager.js. In tools.js, they added a line to commit or remove the current drawing session. In touch_manager.js, they wrapped the abort call in a null check.

The test needs to simulate the scenario where the error occurs. The user mentioned that zooming and drawing often triggers the error when lifting the finger, which is the touchend event.

I'll use the test file provided. I'll need to set up a PDF document, enable touch events, and simulate the actions that cause the error.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules, like PDFWorker and TouchManager. Then, I'll create a PDF document using getDocument. I'll set up a container and viewer to simulate the display.

Next, I'll create a TouchManager instance, which is where the error occurs. I'll simulate touch events: touchstart, touchmove, and touchend. The key is to ensure that during touchend, the #touchMoveAC is null, which should no longer cause an error after the patch.

In the test, I'll define a done promise to wait for the touchend event to complete. I'll use event listeners to track when touchend is handled without errors.

Finally, I'll assert that no error was thrown during the touch handling, indicating the patch fixed the issue.

```javascript
it("should handle touch events without crashing when #touchMoveAC is null", async () => {
  const { PDFWorker } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { TouchManager } = await import("../../src/display/touch_manager.js");
  
  // Setup a simple PDF document for testing
  const pdfDocument = await getDocument({
    data: new Uint8Array(),
    fingerprint: "test-pdf",
    length: 0,
  });

  // Create a container and viewer for the test
  const container = {
    addEventListener: () => {},
    removeEventListener: () => {},
  };
  const viewer = {
    get pageView() {
      return {
        get viewport() {
          return { width: 100, height: 100 };
        },
      };
    },
  };

  // Create TouchManager instance
  const touchManager = new TouchManager({
    container,
    signal: new AbortController().signal,
  });

  // Test touch events that could trigger the error
  const done = () => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      const touchStart = new Event("touchstart");
      const touchMove = new Event("touchmove");
      const touchEnd = new Event("touchend");

      touchManager.#onTouchStart(touchStart);
      touchManager.#onTouchMove(touchMove);
      
      // Ensure #touchMoveAC is null when handling touchend
      const originalTouchMoveAC = touchManager.#touchMoveAC;
      touchManager.#touchMoveAC = null;

      const handleTouchEnd = () => {
        touchManager.#onTouchEnd(touchEnd);
        resolve();
      };

      touchManager.#container.addEventListener("touchend", handleTouchEnd, { once: true });
      touchManager.#container.dispatchEvent(touchEnd);
    });
  };

  // Verify that no error is thrown during touch handling
  await expect(done()).resolves.not.toThrow();
});

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch fixes the issue where a TypeError occurs when using annotations on iOS Safari. The error happens because `this.#touchMoveAC.abort()` is called when `this.#touchMoveAC` is null. 

First, I'll look at the provided code. The patch modifies two files: `tools.js` and `touch_manager.js`. In `touch_manager.js`, they added a check to ensure `#touchMoveAC` isn't null before calling `abort()`. 

So, the test should simulate the scenario where `#touchMoveAC` becomes null and then `abort()` is called. I'll need to mock this situation.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I need `TouchManager` from `touch_manager.js` and maybe some utilities.

In the test, I'll create an instance of `TouchManager` with a container. Then, I'll simulate a touch event that causes `#touchMoveAC` to be set. After that, I'll nullify `#touchMoveAC` to mimic the bug scenario. Finally, I'll trigger another event to see if calling `abort()` on a null `#touchMoveAC` throws an error.

I should use a try-catch block to catch any errors during the test. If the patch works, the code shouldn't throw an error when `abort()` is called on a null `#touchMoveAC`.

I also need to ensure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with `it` and use async functions for any promises.

So, putting it all together, the test will initialize the `TouchManager`, simulate touch events, and check that no error is thrown after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should handle null touchMoveAC without throwing error", async () => {
  const { TouchManager } = await import("../../src/display/touch_manager.js");
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  
  // Initialize TouchManager
  const touchManager = new TouchManager({
    container,
    signal: new AbortController().signal,
  });

  // Simulate touch events that would set up touchMoveAC
  const touchStartEvt = new TouchEvent("touchstart", {
    touches: [new Touch({ identifier: 1, target: container }), new Touch({ identifier: 2, target: container })],
  });
  container.dispatchEvent(touchStartEvt);

  // Simulate touch move to set touchMoveAC
  const touchMoveEvt = new TouchEvent("touchmove", {
    touches: [new Touch({ identifier: 1, target: container }), new Touch({ identifier: 2, target: container })],
  });
  container.dispatchEvent(touchMoveEvt);

  // Nullify touchMoveAC to simulate the bug scenario
  touchManager.#touchMoveAC = null;

  // Test that aborting a null touchMoveAC doesn't throw
  try {
    touchManager.#touchMoveAC.abort();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Expected no error when aborting null touchMoveAC");
  }

  // Cleanup
  touchManager.destroy();
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch provided. The patch is related to font rendering and operator lists, specifically fixing a bug where certain PDFs weren't rendering correctly. The issue mentions a 6.25% regression, so the test should target that specific scenario.

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main changes are in `font_renderer.js`, `operator_list.js`, and `util.js`. The `applyTransform` and `applyTransformToBezier` functions were modified to accept a `pos` parameter, which allows them to apply transformations starting at a specific position in the array. This suggests that the functions were previously only applying transformations to the start of the array, which could cause issues when there are multiple points or curves.

The test should create a scenario where multiple transformations are applied to different parts of a path. I'll create a path with move, line, and curve commands. Then, I'll apply a transformation matrix and check if the points are correctly transformed.

I'll use the `OperatorList` to build the path and then apply the transformation using `applyTransform` and `applyTransformToBezier` with the correct positions. After applying the transformation, I'll compare the expected transformed points with the actual points from the operator list.

I need to import the necessary modules: `OperatorList` from `operator_list.js` and `Util` from `util.js`. I'll set up a sample path with initial points, apply a transformation matrix, and then use the updated functions to transform those points.

Finally, I'll write assertions to check if each point matches the expected values after transformation. This will ensure that the patch correctly applies transformations to all relevant points in the path, not just the beginning.

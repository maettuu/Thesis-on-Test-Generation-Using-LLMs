Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug mentioned. The issue is related to PDF rendering, specifically a regression caused by changes in how transformations are applied in the font renderer. The patch modifies several files, including font_renderer.js, operator_list.js, and util.js.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the applyTransform functions in util.js were updated to accept a position parameter, which allows them to modify specific parts of an array. The Calls to these functions in font_renderer.js and operator_list.js were also changed to pass this new parameter.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that checks if the transformation is correctly applied when using the new position parameter.

I'll create a test PDF that includes a transformed glyph. Then, I'll render it using pdf.js and check if the transformation is correctly applied by comparing the SVG output.

I'll import the necessary modules, create a mock PDF document with a glyph, apply a transformation, and then check the SVG output to see if the points have been transformed correctly.

I'll use Jest for the test structure, making sure to handle the async operations properly. The test will include a before-and-after check, but since I can't run both versions in one test, I'll rely on the expected SVG output to confirm the fix.

I'll structure the test to generate the expected SVG after the patch and compare it with the actual output. If the transformation is applied correctly, the test will pass.

Finally, I'll ensure the test is self-contained, only using the provided imports, and is concise.

```javascript
it("should correctly apply transformations with position parameter", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  const { FontRendererFactory } = await import("../../core/font_renderer.js");
  
  // Sample transformation matrix
  const transform = [2, 0, 0, 2, 10, 20];
  
  // Test data: array of points to transform
  const points = new Float64Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
  
  // Expected result after transformation with position 2
  const expected = new Float64Array([2 * 3 + 10, 2 * 4 + 20, 2 * 5 + 10, 2 * 6 + 20]);
  
  // Apply transformation with position parameter
  Util.applyTransform(points, transform, 2);
  
  // Check if actual result matches expected
  expect(Array.from(points)).toEqual(Array.from(expected));
});
```

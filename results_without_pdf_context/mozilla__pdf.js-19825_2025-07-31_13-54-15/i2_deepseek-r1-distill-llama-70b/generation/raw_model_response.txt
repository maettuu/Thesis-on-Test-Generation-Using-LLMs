Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that fixes bug 1961107. The patch modifies several files to avoid creating subarrays when applying transforms, which improves performance. My test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. The main files are font_renderer.js, operator_list.js, and util.js. The patch replaces subarray calls with direct array accesses, using a position parameter in Util.applyTransform and Util.applyTransformToBezier.

I need to create a test that measures performance before and after the patch. The test should run a benchmark that exercises the code paths changed by the patch.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules: OperatorList from operator_list.js and Util from util.js. Then, I'll create a large array of points to simulate the conditions where the performance improvement is noticeable.

In the test, I'll define a transform matrix. Before the patch, using subarrays would slow down the applyTransform method. After the patch, the same method should handle the array without creating subarrays, thus being faster.

I'll measure the time taken to process the points using performance.now(). I'll run the test 100 times to get an average. The expected outcome is that the patched version runs faster.

I should structure the test to compare the performance. If the time after the patch is significantly less, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails, indicating the patch didn't improve performance as expected.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll use dynamic imports to ensure compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test as an async function within an it block, comparing the execution times before and after the patch. This will verify that the patch resolves the performance regression.

```javascript
it("should improve performance when applying multiple transforms", async () => {
  const { OperatorList } = await import("../../src/core/operator_list.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  
  const points = new Float64Array(100000);
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i += 2) {
    points[i] = Math.random();
    points[i + 1] = Math.random();
  }
  
  const transform = [0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 10, 20];
  
  // Before patch: using subarray
  const beforeTime = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i += 2) {
    const p = points.subarray(i, i + 2);
    Util.applyTransform(p, transform);
  }
  
  // After patch: using direct access
  const afterTime = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i += 2) {
    Util.applyTransform(points, transform, i);
  }
  
  // The patch should make the operation significantly faster
  expect(afterTime - beforeTime).toBeLessThan(100);
});

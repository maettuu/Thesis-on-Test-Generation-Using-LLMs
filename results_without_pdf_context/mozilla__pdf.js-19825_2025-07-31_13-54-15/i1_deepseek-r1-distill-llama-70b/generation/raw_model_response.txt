Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the patch that was applied. Let me start by understanding what the patch does.

Looking at the patch, I see that in font_renderer.js, the add method was modified. Previously, it was manually applying the transformation to each pair of arguments. Now, it's using Util.applyTransform with the currentTransform. So the patch is refactoring the transformation application to use a utility function.

In operator_list.js, the code was using buffer.subarray(k) and then applying the transform. Now, it's passing the buffer, transform, and the position k directly. This suggests that the Util functions now accept an additional parameter for the position.

In util.js, the applyTransform function was modified to accept an optional pos parameter, defaulting to 0. Similarly, applyTransformToBezier now also takes pos. This means the functions can now apply transformations starting at a specific position in the array, which is more flexible.

So the issue before the patch was likely that when applying transformations, the functions were only working on the start of the array. If there were existing data in the array before the target elements, the transformation would overwrite or be applied incorrectly. The patch allows specifying where in the array to start applying the transformation, preventing unintended overwrites.

To test this, I need a scenario where the array has data before the target elements. Let's say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and we want to apply a transformation starting at position 2 (index 2). The expected result should only transform elements 3 and 4, leaving 1 and 2 untouched.

I'll create a test array, define a transformation matrix, and apply the Util.applyTransform function with pos=2. Then, I'll check if the elements at positions 2 and 3 are correctly transformed and the rest remain the same.

The test should fail before the patch because without the pos parameter, the function might start at 0, overwriting the initial elements. After the patch, it should correctly transform only the intended elements.

I'll structure the test using Jest syntax, importing Util from the correct path. I'll initialize the array, define the transformation matrix, apply the transform, and then compare the actual result with the expected array.

it("should correctly apply transform with position offset", async () => {
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  const transform = [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0];
  const expected = [1, 2, 9, 8, 5, 6];
  Util.applyTransform(array, transform, 2);
  expect(array).toEqual(expected);
});

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where elements like comments and sticky notes aren't displayed in the PDF viewer after the patch was applied. The user provided a patch that modifies the `annotation.js` file, adjusting the `noHTML` flags for various annotation types. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch sets `noHTML` to `false` for several annotation classes like `PopupAnnotation`, `TextAnnotation`, `LineAnnotation`, etc. This is because if an annotation has its own canvas (`hasOwnCanvas` is true), it needs an HTML container to render it, so `noHTML` should be false to ensure the HTML is generated.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that checks if the `noHTML` flag is correctly set to false for these annotations when they have their own canvas.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for compatibility. I'll import `Annotation` and `AnnotationFactory` from their respective paths.

Next, I'll set up a fake PDF document with a page. I'll create a mock `XRef` object to handle cross-references. Then, I'll create instances of each annotation type that should have `noHTML` set to false. For each annotation, I'll assert that `noHTML` is indeed false.

I'll loop through each annotation type, create an instance, and check the `noHTML` property. If any of them don't have `noHTML` as false, the test will fail, indicating the issue isn't resolved.

After the patch, running this test should pass because all the specified annotations will have `noHTML` set correctly. This ensures that the HTML elements are rendered, and the comments and sticky notes are displayed as expected.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files or complex setups. Using mocks for `XRef` and creating minimal annotation instances should suffice.

So, the test will create each relevant annotation, check their `noHTML` flags, and ensure they're all false. This directly tests the changes made in the patch, ensuring the regression issue is fixed.

```javascript
it("should correctly set noHTML flag for annotations with hasOwnCanvas", async () => {
  const { Annotation, AnnotationFactory } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { XRef } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");

  // Setup fake PDF document with one page
  const xref = new XRef();
  const pdfDocument = {
    getCatalog: () => ({
      getPages: () => ({
        getKids: () => [{}],
        getLength: () => 1,
      }),
    }),
  };

  // Test each annotation type that should have noHTML: false
  const annotations = [
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.TEXT, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.POPUP, hasOwnCanvas: false },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.FREETEXT, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.LINE, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.SQUARE, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.POLYLINE, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.STAMP, hasOwnCanvas: true },
    { type: AnnotationFactory.Type.FILEATTACHMENT, hasOwnCanvas: true },
  ];

  for (const { type, hasOwnCanvas } of annotations) {
    const annotation = new AnnotationFactory({
      type,
      xref,
      pdfDocument,
      dict: {},
      params: { hasOwnCanvas },
    }).create();

    expect(annotation.noHTML).toBe(false);
  }
});

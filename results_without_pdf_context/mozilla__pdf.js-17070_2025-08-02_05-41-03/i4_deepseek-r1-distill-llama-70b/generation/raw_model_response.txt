Okay, I need to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The issue is that comments and sticky notes aren't rendered in the viewer. The patch modifies the annotation.js file, so the test should target that.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since it's a Node.js test, I'll use dynamic imports for the PDFJS and the test utilities.

I'll create a sample PDF using a library like pdf-lib. The PDF should have a page with a text annotation that isn't rendered correctly before the patch. I'll add a comment using pdf-lib's annotation tools.

Next, I'll load the PDF into the viewer. I'll create a document, get the first page, and render it. I'll extract the text from the page.

Before the patch, the text from the annotation shouldn't be present. After the patch, it should appear. So, in the test, I'll check if the extracted text includes the expected string from the annotation.

I'll structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle any errors during loading or rendering. If everything works, the test should pass; otherwise, it should fail.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and no external dependencies beyond what's necessary for creating the PDF and testing.

Finally, I'll write the test in the specified format, ensuring it's concise and directly addresses the issue.

```javascript
it("should render comment annotations in PDFs", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("pdf-lib");
  const { createPDFViewer } = await import("../../web/pdf_viewer.js");
  const { TextLayerRenderTask } = await import("../../web/text_layer.js");
  const { TestReporter } = await import("./testreporter.js");

  // Create a test PDF with a text annotation
  const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdfDoc.addPage();
  const annotation = new PDFAnnotation().setText("Test comment");
  page.addAnnotation(annotation);
  
  // Load the PDF document
  const pdfViewer = createPDFViewer({
    container: document.createElement("div"),
    viewer: document.createElement("div"),
  });
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfDoc);
  const pageView = pdfViewer.openPDF(pdf);

  // Render the page
  await pageView.render();
  const textLayer = new TextLayerRenderTask(pageView);
  const text = await textLayer.getText();

  // Verify the annotation text is rendered
  expect(text).toContain("Test comment");
});
```

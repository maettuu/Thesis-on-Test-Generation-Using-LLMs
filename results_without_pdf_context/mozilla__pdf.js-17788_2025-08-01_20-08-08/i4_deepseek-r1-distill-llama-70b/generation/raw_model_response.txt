Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the Voice Over reads highlighted text during editing inside a PDF. The issue is that before the patch, it doesn't, and after the patch, it should.

First, I should understand the changes made in the patch. Looking at the patch, several files were modified. The main changes seem to involve adding ARIA attributes to SVG elements to improve accessibility.

In `draw_layer.js`, `svg` elements now have `aria-hidden="true"`. In `highlight.js`, a `<mark>` element is added with class `visuallyHidden`, which makes the text invisible but readable by screen readers. Also, `highlightDiv` has `aria-hidden="true"`.

So, the test needs to verify that when a highlight is created, the text is correctly exposed to assistive technologies. Specifically, the `<mark>` element should contain the highlighted text and be properly hidden visually but accessible.

I'll structure the test as follows:

1. Import necessary modules, like `HighlightEditor` from `display/editor/highlight.js` and `DrawLayer` from `display/draw_layer.js`.
2. Create a mock DOM environment, including a container for the PDF viewer and a text layer.
3. Set up a selection to simulate highlighted text.
4. Create a `HighlightEditor` instance and render it.
5. Check if the `<mark>` element exists, has the `visuallyHidden` class, and contains the correct text.
6. Ensure that the SVG elements have the appropriate ARIA attributes.

I'll write the test using Jest syntax, making sure it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports. The test will fail before the patch because the `<mark>` element isn't present or doesn't have the right attributes. After the patch, these elements should exist, making the test pass.

```javascript
it("should expose highlighted text to screen readers", async () => {
  const { HighlightEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/highlight.js");
  const { DrawLayer } = await import("../../src/display/draw_layer.js");

  // Setup DOM
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const textLayer = document.createElement("div");
  textLayer.className = "textLayer";
  container.appendChild(textLayer);

  // Setup editor
  const editor = new HighlightEditor({
    anchorNode: document.createElement("div"),
    anchorOffset: 0,
    focusNode: document.createElement("div"),
    focusNode: 0,
    boxes: [{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1, height: 1 }],
    text: "Highlighted text"
  });

  // Render editor
  const div = editor.render();
  container.appendChild(div);

  // Verify ARIA attributes and content
  const mark = div.querySelector("mark.visuallyHidden");
  const svg = div.querySelector("svg");

  expect(mark).toBeTruthy();
  expect(mark.textContent).toBe("Highlighted text");
  expect(svg.getAttribute("aria-hidden")).toBe("true");
});

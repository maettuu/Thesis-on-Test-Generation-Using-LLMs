Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the highlight on a cropped PDF isn't visible when saving or printing. The patch provided modifies the serializeBoxes and serializeOutlines methods to include the rect parameter, which I assume is related to the crop box.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the methods now take a rect parameter which is used to calculate the correct coordinates for the highlights. Before the patch, the serializeBoxes and serializeOutlines didn't account for the crop box, so the highlights were drawn incorrectly when the PDF was cropped.

So, the test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. I'll create a test that simulates a cropped PDF and checks if the highlight's coordinates are correctly calculated.

I'll use a sample PDF that has a crop box. I'll create a PDFPage and render it, then add a highlight. After applying the patch, the highlight's quadPoints should reflect the cropped area.

In the test, I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument and PDFPage. I'll load a test PDF with a crop box, create a highlight editor, and serialize it. Then, I'll check if the quadPoints include the crop box offset.

Before the patch, the quadPoints wouldn't include the crop box, so the test would fail. After the patch, they should, so the test passes.

I'll structure the test using Jest syntax, making sure to import dynamically and keep it self-contained. I'll also use async/await for the imports and PDF loading.

Finally, I'll write the test to compare the expected and actual quadPoints, ensuring they include the crop box offset after the patch.

```javascript
it("should correctly calculate highlight positions when PDF has a crop box", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/pdf_document.js");
  const { PDFPage } = await import("../../src/core/pdf_page.js");
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("./editor.js");
  
  // Load a test PDF with crop box
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(await fetch("test.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer()));
  const page = pdf.getPage(0);
  
  // Create highlight editor with test data
  const highlightEditor = new AnnotationEditor({
    pageIndex: 0,
    color: "#ff0000",
    opacity: 0.5,
    boxes: [{x: 0.1, y: 0.1, width: 0.2, height: 0.2}],
    pageDimensions: [page.getWidth(), page.getHeight()],
    uiManager: null
  });
  
  // Serialize the highlight data
  const serialized = highlightEditor.serialize();
  
  // The expected quadPoints should include the crop box offset
  const expectedQuadPoints = [100, 100, 200, 200, 150, 150, 250, 250];
  
  // After the patch, the quadPoints should match the expected values
  expect(serialized.quadPoints).toEqual(expectedQuadPoints);
});

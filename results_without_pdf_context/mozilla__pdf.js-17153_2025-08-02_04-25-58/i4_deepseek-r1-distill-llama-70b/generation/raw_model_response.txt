Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where `navigator` does not contain the `platform` attribute, causing an error when using `pdfjs-dist/build/pdf` in a Node.js environment. The user provided a patch that modifies `util.js` to handle cases where `navigator` might not exist or not have `platform`.

First, I should understand the problem. The original code assumes `navigator.platform` exists, which isn't the case in Node.js. The patch adds checks for `navigator` and its properties before accessing them.

My test needs to simulate a Node.js environment where `navigator` is undefined. I'll use `jest` to mock `navigator` and `globalThis.document` to ensure the test runs correctly in Node.js.

I'll structure the test to import the necessary modules dynamically. I'll create an instance of `FontLoader` with a mocked `document` object. Then, I'll check if the `platform` property correctly defaults to `isMac: false` when `navigator` is not available.

I'll use async/await for the imports since the test is asynchronous. The test will assert that `platform.isMac` is false, ensuring the patch works as intended.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. I'll structure the test with clear variable names and concise steps to ensure readability.

Finally, I'll write the test in the specified format, ensuring it fits the example structure and only returns the JavaScript code without any comments or explanations.

```javascript
it("should handle missing navigator.platform in Node.js", async () => {
  const { FontLoader, FeatureTest } = await import("../../src/display/font_loader.js");
  const { shadow } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  // Mock the Node.js environment where navigator is not available
  const mockDocument = { document: { documentElement: {} } };
  const fontLoader = new FontLoader(mockDocument);

  // Verify platform property defaults correctly when navigator is missing
  const platform = await FeatureTest.platform;
  expect(platform.isMac).toBe(false);
});
```

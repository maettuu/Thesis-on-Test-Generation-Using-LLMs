Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where font fallback doesn't work on the node-js/legacy build. The user provided a patch that adds a mapping for "HelveticaLTStd-Bold" to "Helvetica-Bold" in the standard_fonts.js file. 

First, I should understand what the problem is. The issue is that when rendering a PDF with HelveticaLTStd fonts, the text isn't showing up because the font isn't found, leading to empty spaces. The patch adds a new entry to the font map so that HelveticaLTStd-Bold falls back to Helvetica-Bold.

To write the test, I need to simulate the scenario where the font isn't available and check if the fallback works. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll use the PDF provided, Tax3921.pdf, which uses HelveticaLTStd fonts. The test will try to render this PDF and check if the text is present. If the fallback works, the text should be rendered correctly.

I'll use the pdfjs-lib library to load the PDF and render the first page. I'll extract the text from the first page and check if it contains the expected string, like "If you". If the text is present, the fallback worked.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically. I'll also handle exceptions in case the PDF can't be loaded or the text isn't found.

So, the test will:
1. Import the PDFDocument and pdfjsLib from the correct paths.
2. Load the sample PDF.
3. Render the first page and extract the text.
4. Check if the expected text is present.
5. Throw an error if the text isn't found, which will make the test fail before the patch and pass after.

I should structure the test with async/await for clarity and use try-catch to handle any errors during loading or rendering.

Finally, I'll write the test as an it block with the correct description and ensure it only returns the JavaScript code without any extra comments.

```javascript
it("should correctly render HelveticaLTStd fonts with fallback", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { pdfjsLib } = await import("../../src/display/node_utils.js");

  // Load the sample PDF with HelveticaLTStd fonts
  const pdfBytes = await fetch("/tmp/Tax3921.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfBytes, { useWorker: false });

  // Render first page and extract text
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
  const text = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join("");

  // Expected text from the rendered page
  const expectedText = "If you";

  // Check if the expected text is present
  if (!text.includes(expectedText)) {
    throw new Error("Font fallback did not work, text not rendered");
  }
});
```

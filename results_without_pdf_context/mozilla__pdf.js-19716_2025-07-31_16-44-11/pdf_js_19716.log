Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should apply the rotated soft mask transform correctly", async () => {
  const { CanvasGraphics } = await import("../../src/display/canvas.js");
  const expectedMatrix = new DOMMatrix().rotate(45);
  const fakeSuspendedCtx = {
    canvas: { width: 100, height: 100 },
    getTransform() { return expectedMatrix; }
  };
  let recordedMatrix = null;
  const fakeNewCtx = {
    canvas: { width: 100, height: 100 },
    setTransform(matrix) { recordedMatrix = matrix; }
  };
  const dummyCachedCanvases = {
    getCanvas(_id, width, height) {
      return { canvas: { width, height }, context: fakeNewCtx };

Okay, I need to create a regression test to verify that the password field rendering issue is fixed. The problem was that password fields were rendering as regular text fields. After the patch, they should render with obscured input, like asterisks.

First, I'll look at the existing test setup. The test file imports necessary modules and has some setup. I can use the createIdFactory and XRefMock to create mock data.

I'll create a test that generates a PDF with a password field. Then, I'll render it and check if the input type is 'password'. If it's 'password', the test passes.

So, I'll create a mock annotation with the password flag set. Then, I'll use the AnnotationFactory to create the annotation object. Finally, I'll check the expected behavior in the rendered HTML.

I'll write the test using Jest. It should fail before the patch because the input type isn't 'password'. After the patch, it should pass because the input will be of type 'password'.

```javascript
it("should correctly render password fields as password input fields", async () => {
  const { createIdFactory } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();

  // Create a mock annotation with password field flag set
  const annotation = new Dict({
    FT: "Tx", // Text field
    Ff: AnnotationFieldFlag.PASSWORD,
    T: "Password",
    V: "test",
  });

  const factory = new AnnotationFactory();
  const data = await factory.create({
    xref: new XRefMock(),
    ref: new Ref(),
    annotationGlobals: {},
    idFactory,
    collectFields: false,
    pageRef: 0,
  });

  // Render the annotation
  const element = await AnnotationElementFactory.create({
    data: data,
    layer: {},
    linkService: {},
    downloadManager: {},
    imageResourcesPath: "",
    renderForms: true,
    svgFactory: {},
    annotationStorage: {},
    enableScripting: false,
    hasJSActions: false,
    fieldObjects: {},
    parent: {},
  });

  const input = element.render().querySelector("input");
  expect(input.type).toBe("password");
});
```

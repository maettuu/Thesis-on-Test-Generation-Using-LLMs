Okay, I need to write a regression test for the password field bug in PDF.js. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I understand the issue: password fields are rendering as text fields, showing the actual characters instead of obscuring them. The patch modifies how the password flag is handled in the code.

So, the test should check if the input field has the correct type. Before the patch, it's "text"; after, it should be "password".

I'll need a sample PDF with a password field. I can create one or use an existing test file. Let's assume I have one at "test.pdf".

I'll use the PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load the PDF and get the first page. Then, I'll find the text widget annotation, which represents the password field.

In the test, I'll retrieve the annotation and check its type. If the type is "password", the test passes. Otherwise, it fails.

I should structure the test using async/await because loading the PDF is asynchronous. I'll import the necessary modules dynamically to ensure compatibility.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. Also, I should handle any potential errors, maybe with a try-catch block, but the example structure doesn't include that, so I'll keep it simple.

Putting it all together, the test will load the PDF, get the annotation, and check if its type is "password". This should correctly validate the patch's effectiveness.

```javascript
it("should render password fields as password input types", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentLoadingTask } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { TextWidgetAnnotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");

  // Load a PDF with a password field
  const pdf = await PDFDocumentLoadingTask.load("test.pdf");
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();

  // Find the password field annotation
  const passwordAnnotation = annotations.find(annotation => 
    annotation instanceof TextWidgetAnnotation && 
    annotation.data.password
  );

  // The test expects the password field to be correctly identified
  expect(passwordAnnotation.data.password).toBe(true);
});
```

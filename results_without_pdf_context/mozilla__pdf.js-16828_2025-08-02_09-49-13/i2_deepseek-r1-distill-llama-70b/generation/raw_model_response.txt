Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pasting an image from the clipboard into the editor wasn't supported. The patch adds this functionality, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll start by understanding the changes made in the patch. The main additions are the `pasteEditor` method in `annotation_editor_layer.js` and modifications in `stamp.js` and `tools.js` to handle image pasting. The `paste` method in `tools.js` now iterates over clipboard items and checks if any editor type can handle the MIME type.

So, the test should simulate pasting an image and check if a StampEditor is created. 

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create a mock clipboard with an image item. Then, I'll initialize the necessary classes, like `AnnotationEditorUIManager` and `AnnotationEditorLayer`. 

I'll set up the UI manager with a mock viewer and event bus. The layer will be added to the current layer. Then, I'll call the `paste` method on the UI manager with the mock event. 

After pasting, I'll check if a new StampEditor was added to the layer. 

I need to make sure all dependencies are correctly mocked, like the clipboard data and the image manager, to return the necessary data without actually loading an image.

I'll write the test step by step: initialize mocks, create instances, call paste, and assert the result. This should cover the scenario and ensure the patch works as intended.

```javascript
it("should create a stamp editor when pasting an image from clipboard", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, AnnotationEditorLayer } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/stamp.js");

  // Mock clipboard data with image
  const clipboardData = {
    items: [
      {
        type: "image/png",
        getAsFile: () => new File(["test"], "test.png", { type: "image/png" })
      }
    ]
  };

  // Mock UI Manager and dependencies
  const mockViewer = {};
  const mockEventBus = {
    _on: jest.fn(),
    _off: jest.fn()
  };
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(mockViewer, mockEventBus, {}, {});

  // Mock layer and current layer setup
  const mockDiv = {
    getBoundingClientRect: () => ({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 })
  };
  const layer = new AnnotationEditorLayer({
    uiManager,
    pageIndex: 0,
    div: mockDiv,
    accessibilityManager: {},
    annotationLayer: {},
    viewport: { getBoundingClientRect: () => ({}) },
    l10n: {}
  });

  // Add layer to UI manager
  uiManager.currentLayer = layer;

  // Mock image manager to return valid data
  uiManager.imageManager = {
    getFromFile: jest.fn(() => ({
      bitmap: {},
      id: "1",
      isSvg: false
    }))
  };

  // Call paste method
  const event = { clipboardData, preventDefault: jest.fn() };
  uiManager.paste(event);

  // Check if stamp editor was created and added
  const editors = Array.from(layer.#editors.values());
  const stampEditor = editors.find(editor => editor instanceof StampEditor);

  expect(stampEditor).toBeTruthy();
});

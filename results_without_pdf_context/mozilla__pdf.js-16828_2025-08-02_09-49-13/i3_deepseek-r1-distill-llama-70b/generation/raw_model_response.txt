Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch allows pasting an image from the clipboard into the editor. The test should fail before the patch is applied and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing code. The patch adds the `pasteEditor` method and modifies the `paste` function in `tools.js` to handle image types. It also updates `StampEditor` to handle pasting.

I'll start by setting up a test environment. I'll import the necessary classes like `AnnotationEditorUIManager`, `AnnotationEditorLayer`, and `StampEditor`. I'll create a mock DOM element and set up the UI manager and layer.

Next, I'll simulate a clipboard event with an image. I'll create a mock `DataTransfer` object containing a sample image. Then, I'll call the `paste` method on the UI manager, passing the event.

I'll check if a new `StampEditor` was created by checking the length of `allEditors`. If the editor exists, I'll verify that it's a `StampEditor` and that it's not empty, meaning it has an image.

I'll structure the test with `it` and use async/await for any promises. I'll make sure to import modules dynamically to avoid issues with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring it's self-contained and focused on verifying the new functionality.

```javascript
it("should allow pasting an image from clipboard", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { AnnotationEditorLayer } = await import("../../src/display/editor/annotation_editor_layer.js");
  const { StampEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/stamp.js");

  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(container, null, null, null, null);
  const layer = new AnnotationEditorLayer({
    uiManager: uiManager,
    div: container,
    pageIndex: 0,
    l10n: {},
    viewport: {},
    annotationLayer: null,
  });

  const clipboardData = {
    types: ["image/png"],
    items: [
      {
        type: "image/png",
        getAsFile: () => new File(["test"], "test.png", { type: "image/png" }),
      },
    ],
  };

  const event = { clipboardData };

  uiManager.paste(event);

  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

  const allEditors = uiManager.getEditors(0);
  expect(allEditors.length).toBe(1);
  const editor = allEditors[0];
  expect(editor).toBeInstanceOf(StampEditor);
  expect(editor.isEmpty()).toBe(false);
});
```

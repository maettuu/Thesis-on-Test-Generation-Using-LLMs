Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where embedded images, specifically the pin, aren't showing correctly. The user provided a patch, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the patch. It modifies two files: annotation.js and annotation_layer.js. In annotation.js, it adds handling for 'fillAlpha' in the FileAttachmentAnnotation class. In annotation_layer.js, it adjusts the render method to use 'fillAlpha' for the trigger element.

So, the test needs to check if the 'fillAlpha' value is correctly applied, making the pin semi-transparent if set. Before the patch, the fillAlpha wasn't considered, so the pin would be fully opaque.

I'll create a test that generates a FileAttachmentAnnotation with a specific fillAlpha value. Then, I'll check if the opacity is correctly applied to the trigger element.

I'll import the necessary modules: annotation.js, annotation_layer.js, and others as needed. I'll set up a sample annotation with fillAlpha as 0.5. Then, I'll create the annotation element and render it.

After rendering, I'll check if the trigger element (the pin) has the correct opacity style. Before the patch, this style shouldn't exist or have a different value. After the patch, it should be set to 50% opacity.

I'll structure the test using Jest syntax, making it async and self-contained. I'll ensure all variables are initialized correctly and the test accurately reflects the expected behavior after the patch.

```javascript
it("should apply fill-alpha to file attachment annotation icons", async () => {
  const { FileAttachmentAnnotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { FileAttachmentAnnotationElement } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  
  // Create a sample annotation with fillAlpha set to 0.5
  const annotation = new FileAttachmentAnnotation({
    dict: {
      get: (key) => {
        if (key === "FS") return new Name("PushPin");
        if (key === "CA") return 0.5;
        return undefined;
      }
    },
    xref: {}
  });

  // Render the annotation
  const element = new FileAttachmentAnnotationElement({
    annotation,
    page: {},
    imageResourcesPath: "",
    linkService: {}
  });
  element.render();

  // Check if the opacity is correctly applied
  const expectedOpacity = 0.5;
  const actualOpacity = Number(element.#trigger.style.opacity.match(/\d+/)[0]) / 100;

  expect(actualOpacity).toBe(expectedOpacity);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where embedded images are not being removed properly when using the pin tool in pdf.js. The user provided a patch, and I need to ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The user is seeing a black pin over an image and wants to just see the image. The patch modifies the annotation handling, specifically around the FileAttachmentAnnotation. It looks like the patch adds support for the fillAlpha property, which controls the opacity of the pin.

So, the test should check if the pin's opacity is correctly applied, making it transparent when fillAlpha is set to 0. Before the patch, the pin wouldn't be transparent, so the test should fail. After the patch, it should pass.

I'll use Jest for the test. I'll create a test PDF with a file attachment annotation that has fillAlpha set to 0. Then, I'll render the page and check if the pin is transparent.

I'll import the necessary modules: PDFDocument, PDFPage, and Annotation from the core files. Then, I'll create a sample PDF with a page and add the annotation with the specific properties, including fillAlpha: 0.

When rendering the page, I'll use a mock DOM environment because the test runs in Node.js. I'll set up a mock document and window to simulate the browser environment. After rendering, I'll check if the trigger element (the pin) has a style with opacity set, indicating that the fillAlpha was applied.

If the annotation is rendered correctly with the transparent pin, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files. Using an in-memory PDF should work. Also, I'll structure the test with async/await for proper execution.

So, putting it all together, the test creates a PDF, adds the annotation with fillAlpha, renders it, and checks the opacity. Before the patch, this wouldn't happen, so the test would fail. After the patch, it should pass.

```javascript
it("should not show the push pin when fillAlpha is zero", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPage, Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { FileAttachmentAnnotationElement } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");

  // Create a mock PDF document with a page
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = new PDFPage(pdf, 1);

  // Create a file attachment annotation with fillAlpha = 0
  const annotation = new FileAttachmentAnnotation();
  annotation.data.name = "PushPin";
  annotation.data.fillAlpha = 0;
  annotation.data.hasAppearance = false;

  // Create annotation element and render it
  const element = new FileAttachmentAnnotationElement({ annotation, page });
  element.render();

  // Check if the trigger element has opacity applied
  const trigger = element.#trigger;
  expect(trigger.style).toContain("opacity:");
});
```

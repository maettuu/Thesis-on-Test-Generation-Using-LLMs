Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the fix for the issue where embedded images are not hidden when they should be. The user provided a patch that modifies the FileAttachmentAnnotation class and the annotation_layer.js file. 

First, I'll look at the patch. In the patch, they added handling for the 'ca' entry in the annotation dictionary. This entry is the alpha channel for the fill color. So, the annotation's opacity can now be adjusted.

The test should check that when the fillAlpha is set, the pin (the embedded image) becomes transparent or hidden as expected. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test needs to create an annotation, I'll use the AnnotationFactory and related classes. 

I'll create a sample annotation with a pin and set the 'ca' value to 0, which should make it fully transparent. Then, I'll render it and check if the pin is hidden.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create an annotation with the specific parameters, render it, and then check the DOM elements to see if the pin is present but hidden.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll also ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after applying it.

```javascript
it("should hide embedded images when fillAlpha is set to 0", async () => {
  const { AnnotationFactory, Util } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { DOMSVGFactory } = await import("../../src/display_utils.js");
  
  // Create a sample annotation with fillAlpha set to 0
  const annotation = {
    subtype: "FileAttachment",
    rect: [0, 0, 100, 100],
    dict: {
      get: (key) => {
        if (key === "ca") return 0;
        return null;
      },
    },
  };
  
  // Render the annotation
  const svgFactory = new DOMSVGFactory();
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  const layer = {
    div: container,
    viewport: {
      rawDims: { pageWidth: 100, pageHeight: 100, pageX: 0, pageY: 0 },
    },
    linkService: {},
    downloadManager: {},
    imageResourcesPath: "",
    renderForms: false,
    annotationStorage: {},
    parent: { zIndex: 0 },
  };
  
  const elementParams = {
    data: annotation,
    layer: layer,
    linkService: {},
    downloadManager: {},
    imageResourcesPath: "",
    renderForms: false,
    svgFactory: svgFactory,
    annotationStorage: {},
    parent: layer,
  };
  
  const annotationElement = AnnotationElementFactory.create(elementParams);
  const rendered = annotationElement.render();
  
  // Check if the pin is hidden
  const pin = rendered.querySelector("img");
  expect(pin).not.toBeNull();
  expect(pin.style.opacity).toBe("0");
});
```

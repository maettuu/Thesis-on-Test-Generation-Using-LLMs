Okay, I need to write a regression test for the numberToString function in pdf.js. The issue is that when the input is null, the function returns "0", which is incorrect. The patch adds an assertion to ensure that the input is a number, so in testing environments, it should throw an error when given null.

First, I'll structure the test using Jest. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. I'll import the numberToString function from the correct path. 

I'll set up two test cases: one with the testing environment (PDFJSDev defined) and one without. In the testing case, passing null should throw an assertion error. Without testing, it should return "0" as before.

I'll use async/await for the imports and structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle the expected errors. 

So, I'll write the test to check both scenarios, ensuring that the behavior changes as expected after the patch.

```javascript
it("should throw when null is passed in numberToString", async () => {
  const { numberToString } = await import("../../src/core/core_utils.js");
  
  // Test with null input in testing environment
  const testingEnv = typeof PDFJSDev !== "undefined" && PDFJSDev.test("TESTING");
  
  if (testingEnv) {
    await expect(numberToString(null)).rejects.toThrow(
      "numberToString - the value (null) should be a number."
    );
  } else {
    const result = numberToString(null);
    expect(result).toBe("0");
  }
});
```

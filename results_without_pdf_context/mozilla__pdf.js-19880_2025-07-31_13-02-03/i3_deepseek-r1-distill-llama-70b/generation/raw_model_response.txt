Okay, I need to write a regression test for the numberToString function in pdf.js. The issue is that when the input is null, the function returns "0", which is incorrect. The patch adds an assertion to ensure that the input is a number, so in testing environments, passing null should throw an error.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It imports numberToString from core_utils.js, so I can use that. I'll need to write a test case that checks the behavior when null is passed.

Before the patch, numberToString(null) returns "0". After the patch, in a testing environment, it should throw an assertion error because the function now checks that the input is a number.

So, the test should have two parts: one for the production environment (where the assertion is skipped) and one for testing (where the assertion is active). In production, numberToString(null) should return "0" as before. In testing, it should throw an error.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it block. I'll create two scenarios: one without the testing flag and one with it. For each, I'll mock the PDFJSDev environment variable.

In the first scenario, I'll set PDFJSDev to undefined to simulate production. Then, I'll call numberToString(null) and expect it to return "0". 

In the second scenario, I'll set PDFJSDev to an object with a test method that returns true. This will enable the assertion. Then, I'll expect numberToString(null) to throw an error with the correct message.

I'll use Jest's describe block to group these tests, but since the user asked for exactly one it block, I'll structure it accordingly. I'll also need to handle the PDFJSDev mocking correctly, ensuring each test case resets the environment.

I should import the necessary modules, like numberToString and assert from the shared utilities. Then, within the test, I'll define the expected results and perform the actual calls, comparing them using expect statements.

So, putting it all together, the test will check both scenarios, ensuring that the function behaves correctly before and after the patch.

```javascript
it("should handle null values in numberToString", async () => {
  const { numberToString } = await import("../../src/core/core_utils.js");
  const { assert } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  // Test without PDFJSDev (production behavior)
  {
    const originalPDFJSDev = global.PDFJSDev;
    delete global.PDFJSDev;
    const result = numberToString(null);
    expect(result).toBe("0");
    global.PDFJSDev = originalPDFJSDev;
  }

  // Test with PDFJSDev (testing behavior)
  {
    global.PDFJSDev = { test: () => true };
    expect(() => numberToString(null)).toThrow(
      "numberToString - the value (null) should be a number."
    );
    delete global.PDFJSDev;
  }
});
```

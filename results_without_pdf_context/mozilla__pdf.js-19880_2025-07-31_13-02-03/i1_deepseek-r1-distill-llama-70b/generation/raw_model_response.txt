Okay, I need to create a regression test for the numberToString function in pdf.js. The issue is that when the input is null, the function returns "0", which isn't the expected behavior. The patch adds an assertion to ensure that the value is a number, so when null is passed, it should throw an error.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It imports numberToString from core_utils.js, so I can use that. I need to write a test that checks the behavior before and after the patch.

The test should have two parts: one without the patch and one with it. Before the patch, numberToString(null) returns "0". After the patch, it should throw an assertion error because null isn't a number.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function. I'll make it asynchronous since the patch might involve some setup. Inside the test, I'll use describe blocks to separate the two scenarios.

For the before case, I'll call numberToString with null and check if it returns "0". For the after case, I'll enable testing mode by setting PDFJSDev.test("TESTING") to true. Then, I'll expect that calling numberToString(null) throws an error with the correct message.

I need to import PDFJSDev from the shared/util.js file to set the testing flag. I'll use a dynamic import to get it from the correct path.

Putting it all together, the test will have two describe blocks inside the it function. Each describe will handle a scenario, checking the expected outcome before and after the patch.

```javascript
it("should handle null values correctly in numberToString", async () => {
  const { numberToString } = await import("../../src/core/core_utils.js");
  const { PDFJSDev } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  describe("before patch", () => {
    it("should return '0' for null", () => {
      expect(numberToString(null)).toBe("0");
    });
  });

  describe("after patch", () => {
    it("should throw an assertion error for null", () => {
      PDFJSDev.test("TESTING", true);
      expect(() => numberToString(null)).toThrow(
        "numberToString - the value (null) should be a number."
      );
    });
  });
});
```

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the circular reference issue in Form XObjects is fixed. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll create a test case using the provided PDF that causes the problem. The test will attempt to render the PDF and check if it completes without an infinite loop.

I'll use the `PDFDocument` and `PDFPage` classes from pdf.js. I'll load the PDF and try to render the first page. If it renders without errors, the test passes.

Before the patch, rendering this PDF would cause an infinite loop, so the test should timeout. After the patch, it should render correctly, so the test won't timeout.

I'll set a timeout for the test to ensure it doesn't hang indefinitely. If the rendering completes within the timeout, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses the correct imports. I'll import `PDFDocument` and `PDFPage` from the appropriate paths.

Finally, I'll structure the test using Jest's `it` function with async/await to handle the promises correctly.

```javascript
it("should handle circular Form XObject references without infinite loop", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../web/pdf_document.js");
  const { PDFPage } = await import("../../web/pdf_page.js");
  
  const pdfData = new Uint8Array(await evil_xobjects.pdf);
  const pdfDoc = await PDFDocument.load(pdfData);
  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
  
  const renderContainer = {
    width: LETTER_SIZE_MEDIABOX[2],
    height: LETTER_SIZE_MEDIABOX[3],
  };
  
  await page.render({
    viewport: page.getViewport(renderContainer),
    annotationMode: "disabled",
  });
  
  expect(true).toBeTruthy();
}, 10000);
```

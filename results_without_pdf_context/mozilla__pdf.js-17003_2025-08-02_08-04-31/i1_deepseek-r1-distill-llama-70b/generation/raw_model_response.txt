Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where a warning appears in the console when printing a PDF with an added annotation. The warning is "Unknown field name, falling back to empty field name." 

First, I should understand the problem. From the issue description, it seems that the warning is triggered when annotations are being collected for printing, specifically when the code tries to construct a field name but encounters an unknown field type. 

Looking at the patch provided, the changes are in `annotation.js`. The key change is in the `AnnotationFactory._create` method. Before the patch, the code checked if `pageIndex === null` to determine if it's collecting fields. Now, it uses a `collectFields` flag instead. Also, in the `Annotation` constructor, the condition for `pageIndex !== null` was replaced with `collectFields`.

So, the test should simulate the scenario where annotations are being printed, which would involve collecting fields. The goal is to ensure that after the patch, the warning no longer appears.

I'll structure the test as follows:

1. **Setup**: Create a mock PDF document with an annotation. The annotation should have a subtype that's not natively supported to trigger the warning before the patch.
2. **Trigger the issue**: Simulate the process of creating the annotation and check for the warning.
3. **Verify**: Ensure that the warning is not present after the patch.

I'll use the existing test file `test/unit/annotation_spec.js` and add a new test case. I'll import necessary modules like `Dict`, `Name`, `Ref`, and others to create a mock annotation dictionary.

In the test, I'll create a mock annotation with a subtype that's not handled, like "Unknown". Then, I'll set up the `AnnotationFactory` with `collectFields` set to true to mimic the printing scenario. 

I'll use `jest.spyOn` to monitor the `warn` function and check if it's called with the expected message. If the warning is not logged, the test passes.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external PDF files. Using mocks and the `XRefMock` helps achieve this.

So, putting it all together, the test will create an annotation with an unknown subtype, set `collectFields` to true, and check that the warning isn't triggered after the patch.

```javascript
it("should not warn about unknown field names when collecting fields for printing", async () => {
  const { XRefMock, createIdFactory } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const { AnnotationFactory, Annotation, Name, Dict, Ref } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { warn } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const ref = new Ref(1, 0);
  const dict = new Dict();
  dict.set("Subtype", new Name("Unknown"));
  dict.set("T", new Name("title"));
  dict.set("Contents", new Name("contents"));
  dict.set("Rect", [0, 0, 0, 0]);
  dict.set("F", 0);
  
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();
  const annotationGlobals = {
    pdfManager: {
      evaluatorOptions: {}
    },
    acroForm: new Dict(),
    structTreeRoot: null
  };

  const mockWarn = jest.spyOn(Util, "warn");
  
  const annotation = await AnnotationFactory.create(
    xref,
    ref,
    annotationGlobals,
    idFactory,
    true, // collectFields = true
    null
  );

  expect(mockWarn).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    "Unknown field name, falling back to empty field name."
  );
});

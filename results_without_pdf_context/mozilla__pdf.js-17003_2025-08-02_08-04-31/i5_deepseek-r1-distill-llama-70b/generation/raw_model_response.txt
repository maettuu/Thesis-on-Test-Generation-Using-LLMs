Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a warning appears in the console when printing a PDF with an added annotation. The warning is "Warning: Unknown field name, falling back to empty field name." 

First, I should understand the problem. From the issue description, it seems that the warning occurs because of a change in how annotations are handled during printing. The patch provided modifies the AnnotationFactory and Annotation classes, introducing a collectFields parameter. The warning is triggered when certain conditions aren't met, leading to the fallback.

So, the test needs to simulate the scenario where a PDF is opened, an annotation is added, and then printed. Before the patch, this should produce the warning, and after the patch, the warning should not appear.

I'll use the test_utils.js module to set up the test. I'll create a PDF document with a page, add an annotation, and then trigger the print function. I'll need to check the console for the warning.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument, Page, Annotation, and AnnotationFactory. Then, I'll create a sample PDF document, add a page, create an annotation, and attach it to the page.

Next, I'll set up a mock for the print function. Since the warning is logged in the console, I'll monitor the console.warn function. If the warning is logged during the test, the test should fail.

After setting up everything, I'll trigger the print action and check if the console.warn was called with the expected message. If it's not called after the patch, the test passes.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. Also, the test should be concise and only test the specific behavior.

So, putting it all together, the test will create a PDF, add an annotation, and print it while checking for the warning. Before the patch, the warning should be present, causing the test to fail. After the patch, the warning should be resolved, allowing the test to pass.

```javascript
it("should not warn about unknown field names when printing with annotations", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { Annotation, AnnotationFactory } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  
  // Create a test PDF document
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();
  
  // Create a test annotation
  const annotation = new Annotation({
    subtype: "Square",
    page: page,
    rect: [0, 0, 100, 100],
    color: "#FF0000",
    author: "Test Author",
    content: "Test Annotation"
  });

  // Set up console.warn mock
  const originalWarn = console.warn;
  const warningMessage = "Warning: Unknown field name, falling back to empty field name.";
  let warned = false;

  console.warn = (message) => {
    if (message === warningMessage) {
      warned = true;
    }
  };

  // Print the document with the annotation
  const printTask = pdf.print();
  await printTask.promise;

  // Restore console.warn
  console.warn = originalWarn;

  // Assert that the warning was not logged
  expect(warned).toBe(false);
});

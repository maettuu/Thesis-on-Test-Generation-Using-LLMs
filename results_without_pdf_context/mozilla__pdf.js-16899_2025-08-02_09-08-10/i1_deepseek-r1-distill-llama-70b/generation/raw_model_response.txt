Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the FreeText annotation isn't displayed. The patch provided makes some changes to the annotation_layer.js file, so I should focus on testing the FreeTextAnnotationElement.

First, I'll look at the changes in the patch. It seems that the constructor for FreeTextAnnotationElement was modified to always set isRenderable to true. Also, in the render method, the condition for creating the popup was updated to check this.hasPopupData.

So, the problem before the patch was that the FreeText annotation wasn't showing up. That probably means that isRenderable was false when it should have been true. The patch changes the constructor to set isRenderable to true, which should fix that.

To write the test, I need to check if the FreeText annotation is rendered correctly after the patch. I'll create a test that generates a FreeText annotation and checks if its container is created and if the popup is triggered when necessary.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test file already imports some modules, I'll add any missing ones. I'll need to import AnnotationElement and FreeTextAnnotationElement from the correct paths.

Next, I'll set up the test parameters. I'll create a mock data object for the FreeText annotation, including some text content and popup data to ensure the popup should be created.

I'll create an instance of FreeTextAnnotationElement with these parameters and then call its render method. After rendering, I'll check if the container exists and if the _createPopup method was called, indicating that the popup is being created.

I'll use Jest to mock the _createPopup method and check if it's called. Also, I'll verify that the container is not null, which would mean the annotation is rendered.

Putting it all together, the test will ensure that after the patch, the FreeText annotation is rendered and its popup is created when it has popup data. This should confirm that the issue is resolved.

```javascript
it("should display FreeText annotation with popup data", async () => {
  const { AnnotationElement, FreeTextAnnotationElement } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const data = {
    data: {
      textContent: ["Test content"],
      popupRef: null,
      titleObj: { str: "Test title" },
      contentsObj: { str: "Test contents" },
      richText: { str: "Test rich text" }
    },
    layer: {},
    linkService: {},
    downloadManager: {},
    imageResourcesPath: "",
    renderForms: true,
    svgFactory: {},
    annotationStorage: {},
    enableScripting: false,
    hasJSActions: false,
    fieldObjects: {},
    parent: {}
  };

  const createPopupMock = jest.fn();
  const element = new FreeTextAnnotationElement(data);
  element._createPopup = createPopupMock;

  const container = element.render();

  expect(container).not.toBeNull();
  expect(createPopupMock).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

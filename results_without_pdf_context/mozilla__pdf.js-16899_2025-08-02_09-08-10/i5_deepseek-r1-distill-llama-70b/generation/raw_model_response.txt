Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the FreeText annotation isn't displayed. The patch provided makes several changes, so I should understand what those changes do and how they fix the problem.

Looking at the patch, I see that a new static method `_hasPopupData` is added to `AnnotationElement`. This method checks if any of the popup-related data (title, contents, richText) is present. Then, a getter `hasPopupData` is added which uses this method.

In the constructors of various annotation elements like `TextAnnotationElement`, `FreeTextAnnotationElement`, etc., the `isRenderable` parameter is changed from a conditional check to simply `true`. This means that these elements will now always be renderable, which probably fixes the issue where they weren't showing up when they should.

Additionally, in the `render` methods of these elements, the condition for creating the popup is updated. Previously, it checked if `!this.data.popupRef`, but now it also checks `this.hasPopupData`. This ensures that the popup is only created if there's data to display, which might have been the issue causing the FreeText annotation not to show.

So, the test needs to verify that when a FreeText annotation has popup data, it is rendered correctly. I'll create a test that generates a FreeText annotation with some content and checks if it's displayed.

I'll use `PDFDocumentLoadingTask` to load a test PDF. Since the actual PDF isn't provided, I'll assume a sample one. Then, I'll get the first page and its annotation layer. I'll create a FreeText annotation with title and content, add it to the layer, and render it.

After rendering, I'll check if the popup is created. Since the patch ensures that the popup is created when `hasPopupData` is true, the test should pass if the popup exists after rendering.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, uses the correct imports, and follows the structure provided. I'll import `PDFDocumentLoadingTask` and `AnnotationLayer` from the specified paths. I'll set up the test to fail if the popup isn't created, ensuring that the patch resolves the issue.

```javascript
it("should display FreeText annotation with content", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentLoadingTask } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { AnnotationLayer } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");

  // Load a test PDF document
  const pdf = await PDFDocumentLoadingTask.load("../src/test/pdfs/annotation-test.pdf");
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const annotationLayer = new AnnotationLayer({
    page,
    annotations: [],
    renderInteractiveForms: true
  });

  // Create a FreeText annotation with content
  const freeTextAnnotation = new Annotation({
    type: "FreeText",
    titleObj: { str: "Test Title" },
    contentsObj: { str: "Test Content" },
    richText: { str: "<p>Test Rich Text</p>" }
  });

  annotationLayer.annotations.add(freeTextAnnotation);
  await annotationLayer.render();

  // Verify that the popup is created and visible
  const popup = annotationLayer._popup;
  expect(popup).toBeTruthy();
});
```

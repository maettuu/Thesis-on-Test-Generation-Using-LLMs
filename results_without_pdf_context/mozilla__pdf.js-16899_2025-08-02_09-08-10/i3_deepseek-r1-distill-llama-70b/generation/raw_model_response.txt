Okay, so I need to write a test that checks if the FreeText annotation's popup is displayed correctly after the patch. The issue was that the FreeText annotation wasn't showing the popup, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing code. The patch modified several parts, especially the condition for creating popups. In the FreeTextAnnotationElement, the render method now checks if data.popupRef is not present and if hasPopupData is true before creating the popup.

I'll need to create a test that generates a FreeText annotation without a popupRef and with some content to trigger the popup. Then, I'll check if the popup exists after rendering.

I'll use the test_utils.js to get a sample PDF. Maybe the one at "test/pdfs/annotation/free_text.pdf" has FreeText annotations. I'll set up a PDFDocument and PDFPage to get the annotations.

I'll create an AnnotationLayer and render it. After rendering, I'll check the annotation elements. I'll look for a FreeText annotation and see if it has a popup.

In the test, I'll use Jest's async/await for promises. I'll import the necessary modules, but since I'm in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for some modules that might not be available.

So, the steps are:
1. Import the required modules.
2. Load the PDF document and page.
3. Get the annotations from the page.
4. Filter for FreeText annotations.
5. Render the annotation layer.
6. Check if the popup exists for the FreeText annotation.

I'll structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle any errors. The test should expect exactly one FreeText annotation and verify that its popup is rendered.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

```javascript
it("should display FreeText annotation popup correctly", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPageProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const { TEST_PDFS_PATH } = await import("../../src/core/display/annotation_layer.js");

  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/annotation/free_text.pdf`;
  const params = buildGetDocumentParams(pdfPath, {});
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(params);
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);

  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  const freeTextAnnotation = annotations.find(
    (annotation) => annotation.annotationType === "FreeText"
  );

  const { AnnotationLayer } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const layer = new AnnotationLayer({
    div: document.createElement("div"),
    page,
    viewport: page.viewport,
    l10n: new (await import("../../web/l10n_utils.js")).NullL10n(),
    linkService: {},
    downloadManager: {},
  });

  await layer.render({
    annotations: [freeTextAnnotation],
    viewport: page.viewport,
    renderForms: true,
  });

  const popupTrigger = layer.div.querySelector(".freeTextAnnotation");
  const popup = layer.div.querySelector(".popup");

  expect(popupTrigger).toBeTruthy();
  expect(popup).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the FreeText annotation isn't displayed. The patch provided is supposed to fix this by ensuring that the annotation is always rendered. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch modifies several classes to always set isRenderable to true and adds a hasPopupData method. This means that even if certain conditions aren't met, the annotations should still be rendered.

So, the test should check if a FreeText annotation is rendered correctly after the patch. Before the patch, the annotation might not have been rendered if it didn't meet the isRenderable conditions.

I'll create a test that generates a FreeText annotation without any content in titleObj, contentsObj, or richText. This should simulate the case where the annotation wasn't rendered before the patch. Then, I'll check if the container exists, which would mean it's being rendered.

I'll import the necessary modules, like PDFDocument and AnnotationLayer. I'll set up a mock document and create an annotation with the necessary data. Then, I'll render the layer and check if the container is present.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. Also, since it's a Node.js environment, I'll use dynamic imports.

Finally, the test should assert that the container's length is greater than zero, indicating that the annotation was rendered correctly.

```javascript
it("should render FreeText annotation with missing popup data", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { AnnotationLayer } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");

  // Create a mock PDF document
  const pdfDocument = new PDFDocument({
    url: "example.pdf",
    fingerprint: "example-fingerprint",
  });

  // Create a mock annotation with missing popup data
  const annotation = new Annotation({
    type: "FreeText",
    data: {
      popupRef: null,
      titleObj: { str: null },
      contentsObj: { str: null },
      richText: { str: null },
    },
  });

  // Create the annotation layer
  const layer = new AnnotationLayer({
    pdfPage: pdfDocument.getPage(1),
    annotationStorage: new (await import("../../src/display/annotation_storage.js")).AnnotationStorage(),
  });

  // Add the annotation to the layer
  layer.addAnnotation(annotation);

  // Render the layer
  const container = layer.render();

  // The container should exist and have content
  expect(container.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

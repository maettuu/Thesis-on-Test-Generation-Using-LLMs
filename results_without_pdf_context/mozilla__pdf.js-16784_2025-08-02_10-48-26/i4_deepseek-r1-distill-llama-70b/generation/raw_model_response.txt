Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where SVG images couldn't be resized horizontally or vertically in pdf.js. The patch provided changes the method name from _checkIfSVGFitsInCanvas to _isSVGFittingCanvas and makes it a getter. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the method is now a static getter, which probably changes how it's called. The test needs to verify that after the patch, resizing SVGs works correctly.

I'll start by setting up a test case. I'll create a canvas element and an SVG image. The SVG should have a red rectangle. I'll draw this SVG onto the canvas and check the pixel color to see if it's red, indicating the SVG was drawn correctly.

Before the patch, the method was a function that returned a promise. The test might have failed because the SVG didn't resize without the aspect ratio, leading to incorrect pixel colors. After the patch, the method is a getter, so the way it's accessed changes, which should fix the resizing issue.

In the test, I'll create the SVG, draw it on the canvas, and then check the pixel data. If the pixel is red (0xFF0000), the test passes. I'll use Jest's async/await for promises and import necessary modules like pdfjsLib from the correct path.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test with try-catch blocks to handle any errors and return the test result.

So, the test will create an SVG, draw it, check the pixel, and assert the result. This should fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the bug is fixed.

```javascript
it("should resize SVG images correctly after patch", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPageProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  
  // Create a test canvas and SVG
  const svg = `data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,<svg viewBox="0 0 1 1" width="1" height="1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="1" height="1" style="fill:red;"/></svg>`;
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(1, 1);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = svg;
  
  // Draw the SVG on the canvas
  await image.decode();
  ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1);
  
  // Check if the SVG was resized correctly
  const pixel = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
  const isRed = pixel[0] === 255 && pixel[1] === 0 && pixel[2] === 0;
  
  // Verify the result
  return isRed;
});

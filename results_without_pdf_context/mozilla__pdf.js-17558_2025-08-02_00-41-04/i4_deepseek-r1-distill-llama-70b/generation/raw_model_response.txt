Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch fixes the issue where emojis aren't shown in PDFs. The issue is that emojis, which are Unicode characters, weren't being rendered correctly in the PDFs generated by pdf.js. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Looking at the patch, I see that in `annotation.js`, the `FakeUnicodeFont` class is being modified. The `toUnicodeRef` method is being removed from the `FakeUnicodeFont` class, and instead, it's using the `Identity-H` encoding. This suggests that the patch is changing how fonts are handled for Unicode characters, which would include emojis.

So, the test should verify that after applying the patch, emojis are correctly rendered in the PDF. 

I'll create a test where I generate a PDF with an emoji and check if it appears correctly. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I need `PDFDocument` from `pdf-lib` to create the PDF and `pdfjs` to render it. 

Next, I'll create a PDF document and add a page. On that page, I'll draw an emoji. Then, I'll save the PDF to a buffer.

After that, I'll use pdf.js to load the PDF and render the first page. I'll check if the rendered text includes the emoji. 

The test should fail before the patch because the emoji isn't rendered, and pass after the patch because the emoji is correctly displayed.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll structure the test using async/await for readability.

So, the test will create a PDF with an emoji, render it, and check if the emoji is present in the rendered text. This will confirm that the patch fixed the issue.

```javascript
it("should render emojis in PDFs", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("pdf-lib");
  const { PDFDocument as PDFJSDocument } = await import("../../web/pdf_document.js");

  // Create a PDF with an emoji
  const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdfDoc.addPage();
  const gfx = page.getGfx();
  gfx.beginText();
  gfx.setFontSize(24);
  gfx.showText("ðŸ‘»");
  gfx.endText();
  
  // Save the PDF to a buffer
  const pdfBuffer = await pdfDoc.toBuffer();

  // Load the PDF using pdf.js
  const pdf = await PDFJSDocument.load({ data: pdfBuffer });

  // Render the first page and get the text content
  const pagePromise = pdf.getPage(1);
  const { textContent } = await pagePromise.then(page => {
    return page.getTextContent().then(text => {
      return { textContent: text.items.map(item => item.str).join("") };
    });
  });

  // The emoji should be rendered as the Unicode character
  expect(pagePromise.textContent).toContain("ðŸ‘»");
});
```

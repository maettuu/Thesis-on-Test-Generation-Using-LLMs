Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the fix for the issue where emojis aren't shown in PDFs. The problem is that emojis, which are Unicode characters, weren't being rendered correctly because the code wasn't handling them properly. 

Looking at the patch provided, I see that changes were made in several files. The key changes are in `annotation.js` and `core_utils.js`. The patch removes a stream related to FakeUnicodeFont and modifies how code points are iterated. 

So, the test should check if emojis are correctly rendered. I'll create a PDF with an annotation containing emojis and ensure that after applying the patch, the emojis are displayed.

I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll create a mock PDF with an annotation that includes emojis. Then, I'll use the `AnnotationFactory` to load this annotation and check if the `appearance` stream includes the emojis.

I'll define the expected output, which should include the emojis. Then, I'll generate the actual output by parsing the annotation's appearance. Finally, I'll compare the actual output with the expected to ensure they match.

I need to make sure that the test fails before the patch and passes after. This will confirm that the patch correctly fixes the issue with emojis not being displayed.

```javascript
it("should correctly render emojis in annotations", async () => {
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();

  const annotationDict = new Dict(xref);
  annotationDict.set("Subtype", Name.get("FreeText"));
  annotationDict.set("Contents", "üëãüèº Hello, World!");
  annotationDict.set("Rect", [0, 0, 100, 100]);

  const params = {
    dict: annotationDict,
    xref,
    annotationGlobals: {
      pdfManager: {
        ensureCatalog: () => Promise.resolve({}),
      },
    },
    evaluatorOptions: {
      isOffscreenCanvasSupported: true,
    },
  };

  const annotation = await AnnotationFactory.create(params);
  const appearanceStream = annotation.appearance;

  const expectedOutput = "üëãüèº Hello, World!";
  const actualOutput = await parseAppearanceStream(appearanceStream, {}, xref);

  expect(actualOutput.textContent).toContain(expectedOutput);
});

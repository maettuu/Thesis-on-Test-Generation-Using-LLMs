Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where SVG images can't be resized in pdf.js. The patch adds a method to check if SVG fits in the canvas and modifies how SVG URLs are handled. 

First, I'll create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check if resizing an SVG image works correctly.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the ImageManager and any other needed classes.

I'll create a sample SVG image as a data URL. Then, I'll create an ImageManager instance and simulate adding the SVG image. 

Next, I'll set up a canvas element to draw the image. I'll use setTimeout to wait for the image to load and the resizing to take effect. 

I'll check the pixel color after resizing. If the patch works, the image should resize without preserving the aspect ratio, changing the pixel color from red to something else. 

I'll structure the test with Jest, using async/await for promises. The test will assert that the pixel color isn't red, indicating the image was resized correctly.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll avoid adding new dependencies and keep the code concise.

Finally, I'll write the test block, ensuring it's named appropriately and uses async functions to handle the promises correctly.

```javascript
it("should resize SVG images correctly", async () => {
  const { ImageManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const svg = `data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,<svg viewBox="0 0 1 1" width="1" height="1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="1" height="1" style="fill:red;"/></svg>`;
  const imageManager = new ImageManager();
  const image = new Image();
  
  // Simulate adding an SVG image
  imageManager.add(image, "test.svg");
  
  // Create canvas to test resizing
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(1, 3);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  
  // Wait for image to load and be resized
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    image.onload = async () => {
      await setTimeout(() => {
        ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3);
        resolve();
      }, 100);
    };
  });
  
  // Check if the image was resized correctly
  const pixels = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 1, 1).data;
  expect(pixels[0]).not.toBe(255); // Red pixel changed after resize
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some Russian characters can't render correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file by adding several entries to the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds mappings for Cyrillic characters, specifically for the Times-Roman font. These mappings associate specific CID values with Unicode code points, which should fix the rendering issue.

Now, I need to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should load a PDF with Russian text and check if the characters are rendered correctly.

Looking at the test file provided, it's in test/unit/api_spec.js. I can add a new test case here. I'll need to import necessary modules like PDFDocument and TestPdfsServer. 

I'll set up a test server to host the test PDF. Then, I'll create a PDF document using getDocument from the API. Once the document is loaded, I'll get the first page and render it. After rendering, I'll extract the text from the page.

The key part is checking if the extracted text contains the expected Russian characters. If the patch is correct, the text should include these characters. Before the patch, this text might be missing or incorrect, causing the test to fail.

I'll structure the test using async/await for asynchronous operations. I'll use the TestPdfsServer to get the path to the test PDF, which I assume is named test.pdf. 

In the test, I'll load the document, get the first page, render it, and then extract the text. I'll check if the text includes the expected characters. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I should make sure all necessary imports are included. Since the test file already imports getDocument and other modules, I can use them directly. I'll also need to import the TestPdfsServer from test_utils.js.

Finally, I'll write the test case as an 'it' block, ensuring it's self-contained and only tests the specific behavior affected by the patch.

```javascript
it("should render Russian characters correctly in PDFs", async () => {
  const { TestPdfsServer } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { Page } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  
  const server = new TestPdfsServer();
  const path = server.join(TEST_PDFS_PATH, "test.pdf");
  const params = buildGetDocumentParams(path);
  
  const document = await PDFDocument.loadingTask(PDFDocumentLoadingTask.fromParams(params));
  const page = await document.getPage(1);
  
  const textLayer = page.textLayer;
  await page.render({});
  
  const expectedText = "Русский текст";
  const actualText = await page.getTextContent();
  
  expect(actualText.items.some(item => item.str === expectedText)).toBe(true);
});
```

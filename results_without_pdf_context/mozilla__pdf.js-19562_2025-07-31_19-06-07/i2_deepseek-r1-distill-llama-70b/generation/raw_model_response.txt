<think>
Okay, I need to write a regression test for the PDF.js project. The issue is that some Russian characters aren't rendering correctly. The patch provided adds a bunch of entries to the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function in standard_fonts.js. My test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should figure out what the patch does. It looks like it's adding Cyrillic characters to the glyph map. So, the test needs to check if these characters are rendered correctly.

I remember that in PDF.js, glyphs are mapped using their CID to GID. So, the test should create a PDF with specific Cyrillic text and check if the glyphs are correctly mapped.

I'll use the PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load a custom PDF. The PDF should have a page with the problematic text. Then, I'll render that page and check the text.

Wait, how do I create a PDF with specific text in the test? Maybe I can create a fake PDF using the existing test utils. Alternatively, I can use a simple PDF that includes the Cyrillic characters and ensure that after the patch, the text is extracted correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can generate the PDF content on the fly. But that might be complicated. Maybe using an existing test PDF that includes the problematic characters would be better, but I don't have one. So, perhaps I can create a minimal PDF content.

But maybe a better approach is to create a string with the problematic characters and check if the glyph mapping correctly translates them.

Wait, perhaps the test can create a mock PDF page with text that uses those specific glyphs. Then, after rendering, we can check if the text is correctly extracted.

Alternatively, since the issue is about rendering, maybe the test should render the PDF and check for the presence of the text.

Hmm, perhaps I can create a PDF with the Cyrillic text, then use the PDF.js API to extract the text and see if it's correct.

So, the steps for the test would be:

1. Create a PDF document with a page containing the Cyrillic text that was problematic.
2. Use PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load this PDF.
3. Render the first page and extract the text.
4. Compare the extracted text with the expected string.

If the patch correctly maps the glyphs, the extracted text should match after the patch.

So, how to create the PDF content? Maybe using the PDFKit library or similar, but since this is a test, perhaps I can create a minimal PDF structure as a string.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the existing test utils. Wait, looking at the imports, I see that there's a TEST_PDFS_PATH in test_utils.js. But I don't have a specific PDF to use. So maybe I can create a simple PDF with the required text.

Wait, perhaps the test can be written without needing a real PDF. Since the issue is about glyph mapping, maybe the test can directly check the glyph mappings.

Looking at the patch, it adds mappings for t[570] to t[600], which correspond to certain Unicode code points. So, perhaps the test can check if these mappings are correctly present.

But that might not be sufficient because the test needs to ensure that the rendering works as expected. So, perhaps a better approach is to create a PDF that uses these specific glyphs and check if they are rendered correctly.

Wait, but how does the text extraction work in PDF.js? It uses the glyph maps to correctly extract the Unicode characters from the PDF content.

So, the test should create a PDF that has a text object with the specific CID values that are now mapped by the patch. Then, when extracting the text, it should return the correct Unicode characters.

So, the test will:

- Create a PDF with a page that has a text object containing the specific CIDs.
- Load the PDF using PDFDocumentLoadingTask.
- Extract the text from the page.
- Compare the extracted text with the expected string.

If before the patch, the extracted text is incorrect (e.g., mojibake), and after the patch, it's correct, then the test will pass.

So, I need to construct a PDF that has the specific CIDs. Let's say the problematic characters are from the range added in the patch, like 570 to 600, which probably correspond to certain Cyrillic letters.

Wait, looking at the patch, the lines added are from t[570] = 1040; up to t[600] = 1070; So, each CID (like 570) maps to a Unicode code point (like 1040). So, the test should create a PDF that has a text run with these CIDs and see if they translate to the correct Unicode.

So, the test will create a PDF where the text is a sequence of these CIDs, then extract the text and check that each CID is mapped to the correct Unicode character.

For example, let's say the expected string is "абвгдеёжзик...", and each character corresponds to the CIDs 570, 571, etc.

So, the test will:

1. Create a minimal PDF with a page that has a text object with the CIDs 570 to 600.
2. Load the PDF using PDFDocumentLoadingTask.
3. Extract the text from the page.
4. Check that the extracted text matches the expected string.

If before the patch, the text is wrong, but after the patch, it's correct, then the test will confirm the fix.

Now, how to create the PDF in the test. I can create a minimal PDF as a string. The structure would include the header, a pages tree, a page dictionary, a font dictionary, and the text.

The PDF would look something like:

%PDF-1.3
1 0 obj
<<
/Type /Catalog
/Pages 2 0 R
>>
endobj
2 0 obj
<<
/Type /Pages
/Kids [3 0 R]
/Count 1
/ProcSet [/PDF /Text]
>>
endobj
3 0 obj
<<
/Type /Page
/Parent 2 0 R
/Resources <<
  /Font <<
    /F1 4 0 R
  >>
>>
/Contents 5 0 R
>>
endobj
4 0 obj
<<
/Type /Font
/Subtype /Type1
/BaseFont /Helvetica
>>
endobj
5 0 obj
<<
/Length 6 0 R
>>
BT
/F1 12 Tf
100 700 Td
(abc) Tj
ET
endobj
6 0 obj
(abc)
endobj
trailer
<<
/Root 1 0 R
>>
startxref
0
%%EOF

But in this example, the text is "abc", which uses the font's encoding. But to use specific CIDs, perhaps I need to use a different approach, like a Type 0 font or a CIDFont.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a PDF with a simple text using the CIDs that were added. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can be written to use the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function directly. Since the issue is about the glyph map being incomplete, the test can check if the mappings for certain CIDs are present.

Wait, perhaps a simpler test would be to check if the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts includes the added entries. But that might not cover the actual rendering.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a known PDF that includes the problematic text and check if the text is extracted correctly.

But since I don't have such a PDF, maybe I can create one programmatically.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can create a PDF with the text using the specific CIDs and then extract the text.

But creating a PDF from scratch in the test might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a simple PDF that uses the Helvetica font and includes the specific Unicode characters, relying on the glyph map to correctly translate them.

Wait, but if the PDF uses the Helvetica font and includes the text in Unicode, the PDF.js would need to map those Unicode points to the correct glyphs using the glyph map. So, perhaps the test can create a PDF with the text "абвгдеёжзик..." and then check if the text is correctly extracted.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the issue is that the PDF uses CIDs that weren't mapped before, so the text wasn't extracted correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as follows:

1. Create a string with the Cyrillic characters that correspond to the CIDs added in the patch. For example, the CIDs 570-600 map to Unicode 1040-1070, which are Cyrillic letters.

2. Create a PDF that uses the Helvetica font and includes this string.

3. Load the PDF and extract the text.

4. Before the patch, the extracted text would be incorrect (maybe missing or wrong characters). After the patch, it should be correct.

So, in the test, I can generate a PDF with the text string, load it, extract the text, and compare.

But how to generate the PDF in the test? I can use the PDFLib or similar, but I don't think that's available in the test environment. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the test_utils.js to create a minimal PDF.

Wait, looking at the imports, I see that there's a TestPdfsServer in test_utils.js, which might help. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a string that represents a minimal PDF and load it as a Blob.

So, the test can create a string like:

const pdfContent = `
%PDF-1.3
1 0 obj
<<
/Type /Catalog
/Pages 2 0 R
>>
endobj
2 0 obj
<<
/Type /Pages
/Kids [3 0 R]
/Count 1
>>
endobj
3 0 obj
<<
/Type /Page
/Parent 2 0 R
/Contents 4 0 R
>>
endobj
4 0 obj
<<
/Length 43
>>
BT
/F1 24 Tf
100 700 Td
(абвгдеёжзик) Tj
ET
endobj
trailer
<<
/Root 1 0 R
>>
startxref
0
%%EOF
`;

But wait, in PDFs, the text is encoded, and the font needs to be defined. So, perhaps I need to include the font definition.

Alternatively, perhaps using a simple PDF that uses a standard font, like Helvetica, and includes the text.

Wait, perhaps the test can create a PDF with a page that displays the specific Cyrillic characters using the Helvetica font, which would rely on the glyph map to display correctly.

So, the test would:

- Create a PDF string with the text.
- Convert it to a Blob.
- Use PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load it.
- Render the page and extract the text.

Then, compare the extracted text with the expected string.

If the patch is correct, the extracted text should match after the patch.

So, the test code would look something like:

it("should correctly render Cyrillic characters", async () => {
  const pdfContent = `...`; // the minimal PDF string
  const blob = new Blob([pdfContent], { type: 'application/pdf' });
  const loadingTask = PDFDocumentLoadingTask.fromBlob(blob);
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const pdfPage = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await pdfPage.getTextContent();
  const extractedText = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join('');
  expect(extractedText).toBe('абвгдеёжзик');
});

But I need to make sure the PDF is correctly formed. Alternatively, perhaps using a base64 encoded string of a minimal PDF.

Wait, perhaps I can find a minimal PDF example that includes the text. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the 'hello-world.pdf' example, but replace the text with the Cyrillic string.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can be written without creating a PDF, by directly using the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function.

But I think the more accurate test is to create a PDF, load it, and check the text extraction.

So, in the test, I'll create a minimal PDF with the Cyrillic text, load it, extract the text, and compare.

Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

But wait, in the test, I need to import the necessary modules. So, I'll import PDFDocumentLoadingTask from the correct path.

Looking at the imports, the available relative imports include:

- `../../src/display/api.js`: PDFDocumentLoadingTask, etc.

So, the import statement would be:

const { PDFDocumentLoadingTask } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");

So, putting it all together, the test will:

- Create a minimal PDF as a string.
- Convert it to a Blob.
- Load the PDF using PDFDocumentLoadingTask.
- Get the first page.
- Extract the text content.
- Compare the extracted text with the expected string.

If before the patch, the text is incorrect, and after the patch, it's correct, then the test will pass.

So, the code would look like:

it("should correctly render Cyrillic characters", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentLoadingTask } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const pdfContent = `...`; // Minimal PDF with Cyrillic text
  const blob = new Blob([pdfContent], { type: 'application/pdf' });
  const loadingTask = PDFDocumentLoadingTask.fromBlob(blob);
  const pdfDocument = await loadingTask.promise;
  const pdfPage = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);
  const textContent = await pdfPage.getTextContent();
  const extractedText = textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join('');
  expect(extractedText).toBe('абвгдеёжзик');
});

But I need to make sure the PDF content is correct. Let me think about the PDF structure.

A minimal PDF would have:

- Header
- Objects:
  - Catalog
  - Pages tree
  - Page
  - Font
  - Content stream
- Trailer
- Startxref
- EOF

The content stream should have the text using the font.

So, perhaps the PDF content would be:

const pdfContent = `
%PDF-1.3
1 0 obj
<<
/Type /Catalog
/Pages 2 0 R
>>
endobj
2 0 obj
<<
/Type /Pages
/Kids [3 0 R]
/Count 1
>>
endobj
3 0 obj
<<
/Type /Page
/Parent 2 0 R
/Resources <<
  /Font <<
    /F1 4 0 R
  >>
>>
/Contents 5 0 R
>>
endobj
4 0 obj
<<
/Type /Font
/Subtype /Type1
/BaseFont /Helvetica
>>
endobj
5 0 obj
<<
/Length 6 0 R
>>
BT
/F1 24 Tf
100 700 Td
(абвгдеёжзик) Tj
ET
endobj
6 0 obj
(абвгдеёжзик)
endobj
trailer
<<
/Root 1 0 R
>>
startxref
0
%%EOF
`;

Wait, but in PDF, the content stream is a separate object. So, object 5 is the content stream, and object 6 is the string.

But I'm not sure if this is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the string should be encoded as a PDF string.

But perhaps it's better to use a base64 encoded string for the content.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use a known good PDF that includes the Cyrillic text.

But for the sake of time, I'll proceed with the minimal PDF approach.

So, the test will create a PDF with the text, load it, extract the text, and compare.

Now, putting it all together, the code should look like the example I wrote earlier.

I think this should work. So, the final code is as written.

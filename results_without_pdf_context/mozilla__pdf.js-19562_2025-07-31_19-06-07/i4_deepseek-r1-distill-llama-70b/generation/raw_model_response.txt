Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some Russian characters aren't rendering correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, specifically adding a bunch of entries to the glyph map. My test should fail before the patch and pass after applying it.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds mappings for CID values 570 to 600 to Unicode code points 1040 to 1070. These code points likely correspond to Cyrillic characters. So, the problem was that these characters weren't being mapped correctly, causing them to render as unknown symbols.

To test this, I'll create a test that checks if these CID values correctly map to their respective Unicode characters. I'll use the getGlyphMapForStandardFonts function from standard_fonts.js.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary functions and then define the expected mappings. For each CID in 570-600, I'll check if the glyph map returns the correct Unicode code point.

Before the patch, these mappings don't exist, so the test should fail. After applying the patch, the mappings are present, so the test should pass.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import the function and structure the test to loop through each CID and check the expected value.

So, I'll write the test with a loop from 570 to 600, checking each CID against the expected Unicode value. If all checks pass, the test succeeds; otherwise, it fails.

Finally, I'll ensure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts, returning only the JavaScript code without any extra comments.

```javascript
it("should correctly map Cyrillic characters in standard fonts", async () => {
  const { getGlyphMapForStandardFonts } = await import("../../src/core/standard_fonts.js");
  const glyphMap = getGlyphMapForStandardFonts();
  
  // The expected mappings for Cyrillic characters added in the patch
  const expectedMappings = {
    570: 1040, 571: 1041, 572: 1042, 573: 1043, 574: 1044,
    575: 1045, 576: 1046, 577: 1047, 578: 1048, 579: 1049,
    580: 1050, 581: 1051, 582: 1052, 583: 1053, 584: 1054,
    585: 1055, 586: 1056, 587: 1057, 588: 1058, 589: 1059,
    590: 1060, 591: 1061, 592: 1062, 593: 1063, 594: 1064,
    595: 1065, 596: 1066, 597: 1067, 598: 1068, 599: 1069,
    600: 1070
  };

  for (const [cid, expectedUnicode] of Object.entries(expectedMappings)) {
    const actualUnicode = glyphMap[parseInt(cid)];
    expect(actualUnicode).toBe(expectedUnicode);
  }
});
```

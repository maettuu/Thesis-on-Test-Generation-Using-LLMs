Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the warning "loadFont - translateFont failed: 'TypeError: e.peekBytes is not a function'" occurs when loading a specific PDF. The test should fail before the patch and pass after applying the patch.

First, I'll look at the provided patch. It modifies the evaluator.js file, adding checks to ensure that fontFile is a BaseStream and not empty. If it's not, it throws a FormatError. In the catch block, instead of creating a NullStream, it sets fontFile to null.

So, the test should simulate the scenario where the fontFile is not a stream, triggering the error. I'll need to mock a Dict object to represent the invalid fontFile.

I'll structure the test using Jest. The test will:

1. Import the necessary modules, including the PartialEvaluator from evaluator.js.
2. Create a mock font descriptor that returns a Dict instead of a Stream.
3. Use the PartialEvaluator to translate the font, expecting it to handle the invalid fontFile gracefully.
4. Check that the evaluator doesn't throw an error and doesn't create a NullStream, which would cause the warning.

I'll set up the mock descriptor to return the Dict when 'FontFile' is accessed. Then, I'll call translateFont and expect that the evaluator correctly catches the error and doesn't proceed with a NullStream, thus avoiding the TypeError.

The test will pass if no error is thrown during translation, indicating the patch works as intended.

```javascript
it("should handle invalid fontFile without throwing peekBytes error", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const { Dict } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");

  // Mock font descriptor that returns a Dict instead of Stream
  const descriptor = {
    get: () => new Dict()
  };

  // Create evaluator with ignoreErrors option to prevent exceptions
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    ignoreErrors: true
  });

  // Test translation without the patch would throw, with patch it should handle
  const result = await evaluator.translateFont(descriptor, "fontName", null);
  
  // Assert that evaluator didn't create NullStream and handled error properly
  expect(result).toBeUndefined();
});
```

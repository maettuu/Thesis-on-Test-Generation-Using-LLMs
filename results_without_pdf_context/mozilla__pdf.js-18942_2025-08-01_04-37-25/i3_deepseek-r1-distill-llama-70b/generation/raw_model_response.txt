Okay, I need to create a test that verifies the fix for the issue where the loadFont function was throwing a TypeError because e.peekBytes was not a function. The user provided a patch that modifies the evaluator.js file, specifically around the getFontFileType function. 

First, I should understand the problem. The error occurred because the code was expecting a Stream but received a Dict instead. The patch adds checks to ensure that fontFile is a Stream and not empty, throwing a FormatError if it's not. This should prevent the TypeError and handle the error gracefully.

So, the test needs to simulate a scenario where fontFile is not a Stream. I'll create a Dict object to mimic this situation. Then, I'll call the loadFont method with this invalid fontFile and check if it throws the expected FormatError.

I'll set up a PartialEvaluator instance with a mock xref that returns the Dict when fetching the fontRef. Then, I'll call loadFont and use expect().toThrow() to assert that the correct error is thrown.

I also need to make sure that the test doesn't rely on any external files or complex setups, keeping it self-contained and focused on the specific issue.

Finally, I'll structure the test using Jest's async/await syntax and include all necessary imports, ensuring that the test is concise and directly addresses the bug.

```javascript
it("should throw FormatError when fontFile is not a Stream", async () => {
  const { Dict, Name, FormatError, PartialEvaluator, XRefMock } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: null,
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: new Map(),
    builtInCMapCache: new Map(),
    standardFontDataCache: new Map(),
    globalImageCache: new Map(),
    systemFontCache: new Map(),
    options: { ignoreErrors: false }
  });

  const fontRef = { ref: { num: 1, gen: 0 } };
  xref.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce(new Dict());

  await expect(evaluator.loadFont("TestFont", fontRef, null, null, null)).toThrow(
    FormatError
  );
});
```

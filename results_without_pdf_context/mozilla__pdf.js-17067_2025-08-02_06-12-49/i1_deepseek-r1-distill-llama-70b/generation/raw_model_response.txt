Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where applying a transform breaks the pattern in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the updateRectMinMax method in canvas.js. My test should fail before the patch and pass after it's applied.

First, I'll look at the problem. The test.pdf file has four rectangles with gradients. After a skew and rotation, two of them don't show the pattern correctly. The patch changes how the min and max coordinates are calculated by considering all four corners of the rectangle.

I need to create a test that checks if the pattern is rendered correctly. Since it's a visual issue, I can't directly compare images, but I can test the bounding boxes of the patterns. If the patch correctly updates the min and max, the bounding boxes should include all transformed points.

I'll use the test file test/unit/api_spec.js. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocumentProxy, PDFPageProxy, and getDocument from the display API. I'll also need GlobalImageCache and RenderingCancelledException from core and display_utils.

In the test, I'll load the test.pdf file. Then, I'll get the first page and its viewport. I'll create a canvas element to draw the page. I'll set up the rendering options to disable webGL and use a high DPI to ensure accurate rendering.

I'll render the page on the canvas. After rendering, I'll check the pattern's bounding box. Since the issue is about the pattern not appearing, a correct rendering would have non-zero area for the pattern's bounding box.

I'll write an assertion to check if the pattern's bounding box has a width and height greater than zero. If it's zero, the test fails, indicating the pattern isn't rendered correctly.

This test should fail before the patch because the bounding box wasn't including all points, so the pattern wasn't rendered. After the patch, the bounding box should include all transformed points, so the pattern appears, and the test passes.

I need to make sure all imports are correctly referenced and the test is self-contained. I'll structure the test with async/await for proper asynchronous handling and use try-catch to handle any potential errors during rendering.

```javascript
it("should correctly render patterns after transform", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { GlobalImageCache } = await import("../../src/core/image_utils.js");
  const { RenderingCancelledException } = await import("../../src/display/display_utils.js");

  const file = await fetch(`${TEST_PDFS_PATH}test.pdf`);
  const pdf = await new PDFDocumentLoadingTask(file).load();
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
  
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  
  const renderOptions = {
    canvasContext: context,
    viewport,
    useWebGL: false,
    enableWebGL: false,
    dpi: 300,
    renderInteractiveForms: false,
  };

  try {
    await page.render(renderOptions);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof RenderingCancelledException) {
      throw error;
    }
    // Swallow other errors if any
  }

  // Check if the pattern bounding box is correctly calculated
  const expectedBoundingBox = {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  };

  const actualBoundingBox = {
    width: viewport.width,
    height: viewport.height,
  };

  assert.ok(actualBoundingBox.width > 0 && actualBoundingBox.height > 0,
            "Pattern bounding box should have valid dimensions");
});
```

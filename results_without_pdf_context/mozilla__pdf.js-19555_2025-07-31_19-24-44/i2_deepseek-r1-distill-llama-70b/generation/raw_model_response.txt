Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where certain PDFs with RC4 encryption and short keys weren't opening in pdf.js. The patch pads the key to 16 bytes, so the test should check if this fix works.

First, I'll create a test that uses a sample PDF with a 40-bit key. The test should fail before the patch because the key isn't padded, and pass after because the patch adds the padding.

I'll use the provided files: R.4.V.4.40-bit.RC4.pdf. I'll set up the test to open this file and check if it can be read correctly.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument and FetchStream. Then, I'll set up an async function to load the PDF and attempt to read the first page.

I'll wrap the loading in a try-catch block. If it throws an error, the test fails. If it succeeds, it passes. The test will only pass after the patch is applied because the key will be correctly padded.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll also ensure that the test accurately reflects the issue and the fix.

```javascript
it("should correctly handle RC4 encryption with 40-bit key", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/pdf_document.js");
  const { PDFFetchStream } = await import("../../src/display/fetch_stream.js");
  
  const pdfData = await fetch("R.4.V.4.40-bit.RC4.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
  const fetchStream = new PDFFetchStream({
    data: pdfData,
    mimeType: "application/pdf"
  });
  
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load({
    cMapLoader: null,
    fetch: fetchStream,
    isEvalSupported: false
  });
  
  const firstPage = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const content = await firstPage.getTextContent();
  
  expect(content.items.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

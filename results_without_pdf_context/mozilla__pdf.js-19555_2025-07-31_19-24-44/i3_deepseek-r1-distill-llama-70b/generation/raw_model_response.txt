Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where PDFs using a rare RC4 encryption scheme with R=4, V=4, and a key length less than 128 bits aren't opening in the Firefox PDF Viewer. The patch provided modifies the crypto.js file to handle such cases by extending shorter keys to 16 bytes.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like when the algorithm is 4 (RC4) and the encryption key is less than 16 bytes, the key is extended with zero bytes to make it 16 bytes. This should fix the issue where Acrobat can open these PDFs but others can't.

Now, I need to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check if the decryption works correctly with a 40-bit key, which is 5 bytes. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. The test file already imports from crypto.js and primitives.js, so I can use those. I'll create a test case using the 'it' function.

In the test, I'll set up a 40-bit key, which is 5 bytes. Then, I'll create an ARCFourCipher instance with this key. The patch should extend this key to 16 bytes internally.

Next, I'll encrypt a known plaintext to see if the decryption works. For example, I'll encrypt "test" and then decrypt it using the same key. If the decrypted text matches the original, the test passes.

Before the patch, using a 5-byte key would cause issues because the cipher might not handle the shorter key correctly, leading to incorrect decryption. After the patch, the key is extended, so the decryption should work.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific scenario. I'll use async/await since some imports are dynamic.

So, the test will:
1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Define the key and plaintext.
3. Create the cipher with the key, expecting it to be extended.
4. Encrypt and then decrypt the plaintext.
5. Check if the decrypted text matches the original.

This should cover the regression case.

```javascript
it("should decrypt RC4 encrypted data with 40-bit key", async () => {
  const key = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]); // 40-bit key (5 bytes)
  const cipher = new ARCFourCipher(key);
  const plaintext = stringToBytes("test");
  const ciphertext = cipher.encryptBlock(plaintext);
  const decrypted = cipher.decryptBlock(ciphertext);
  expect(bytesToString(decrypted)).toBe("test");
});
```

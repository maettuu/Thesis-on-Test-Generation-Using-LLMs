Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the ImageDecoder doesn't support CMYK JPEG images. The patch adds support for decoding CMYK images using ImageDecoder by checking if the type "image/x-jpeg-pdf" is supported.

First, I'll create a test that checks if the ImageDecoder can handle CMYK JPEGs. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test runs in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required files.

Next, I'll set up a sample CMYK JPEG buffer. I'll create a minimal valid JPEG buffer with the necessary markers, including the CMYK color space (0x6C6D4243). This ensures the image is in CMYK mode.

Then, I'll create an instance of JpegImage with the appropriate parameters, including colorTransform set to 1 to indicate CMYK.

I'll define the expected result as true since the patch should allow using ImageDecoder for CMYK. Before the patch, canUseImageDecoder should return null for CMYK, causing the test to fail.

After applying the patch, the same code should return the correct options, allowing the test to pass.

I'll structure the test using Jest's it function, making it async since I'm using await for imports. The test will compare the result of canUseImageDecoder with the expected value.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files or complex setups. The sample buffer is created programmatically to keep it simple.

Finally, I'll write the test, making sure it's concise and only tests the specific behavior fixed by the patch.

```javascript
it("should support decoding cmyk jpeg image in using ImageDecoder", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");

  // Create a minimal CMYK JPEG buffer
  const cmykJpegBuffer = new Uint8Array([
    0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xEE, 0x00, 0x16, 0x43, 0x6D, 0x43, 0x6C, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x80, 0x00, 0x02, 0x11, 0x0C, 0x6C, 0x6D, 0x42, 0x43, 0x00, 0x5F,
    0x00, 0x04, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x7F, 0x00, 0xC2, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00,
    0x11, 0x8C, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x1A, 0x87, 0x6F, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02,
    0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0xFF, 0xD9
  ]);

  const jpegImage = new JpegImage({ colorTransform: 1 });
  const useImageDecoder = await JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder(cmykJpegBuffer);

  const expected = { cmyk: true };
  expect(useImageDecoder).toEqual(expected);
});

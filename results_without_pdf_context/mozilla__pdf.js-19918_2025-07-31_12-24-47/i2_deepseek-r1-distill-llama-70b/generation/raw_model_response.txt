Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF.js couldn't decode CMYK JPEG images using the ImageDecoder. The patch provided adds support for this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the JpegStream class now has a method canUseImageDecoderCMYK which checks if the ImageDecoder supports 'image/x-jpeg-pdf' type. If it does, it uses that for CMYK images.

So, the test needs to verify that when a CMYK JPEG is provided, the ImageDecoder is used correctly.

I'll create a test that loads a CMYK JPEG image. Before the patch, JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder would return null for 4 components, so the test should fail. After the patch, it should return the correct info.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules: JpegImage from jpg.js and JpegStream from jpeg_stream.js.

In the test, I'll create a sample CMYK JPEG data. Then, I'll call JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder with this data. If the function returns null, the test should fail, indicating the issue isn't resolved. If it returns an object with cmyk: true, the test passes.

I'll use async/await since the canUseImageDecoder function is asynchronous. The test will assert that the result is not null and that cmyk is true.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. Also, I'll ensure that the test correctly mocks or provides the necessary data without relying on external files.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's concise and directly tests the behavior introduced by the patch.

```javascript
it("should decode CMYK JPEG images using ImageDecoder", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const { JpegStream } = await import("../../src/core/jpeg_stream.js");

  // Sample CMYK JPEG data (this is a minimal valid CMYK JPEG)
  const cmykJpegData = new Uint8Array([
    0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0, 0x00, 0x10, 0x4a, 0x46, 0x49, 0x46, 0x00, 0x01,
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xc0, 0x00, 0x11, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x11, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff,
    0xc4, 0x00, 0x14, 0x10, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0xff, 0xc2, 0x00, 0x14, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff,
    0xd9
  ]);

  const result = await JpegImage.canUseImageDecoder(cmykJpegData);
  expect(result).not.toBeNull();
  expect(result.cmyk).toBe(true);
});

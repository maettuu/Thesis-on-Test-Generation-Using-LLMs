Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the free highlighting in PDFs lags behind the mouse cursor. The patch provided modifies the outliner.js file, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch introduces new variables #lastX and #lastY in the FreeOutliner class. It also adds a method #getLastCoords() which calculates coordinates based on these new variables. The add() method now sets this.#lastX and this.#lastY, which are used in the new method.

So, the bug was that the highlighting wasn't keeping up with the cursor because the last coordinates weren't being tracked properly. The patch fixes this by storing the last X and Y positions and using them to adjust the outline.

To test this, I need to simulate adding points and check if the outline correctly follows the cursor. I'll create a test case where I add multiple points in a specific order and then check the generated outline.

I'll import the necessary classes, set up a box and options, create an instance of FreeOutliner, add points, and then get the outlines. I'll compare the expected outline with the actual one to ensure they match after the patch.

The test should be self-contained, so I'll define all variables within the test block. I'll use async/await for imports and structure the test with clear setup and assertion steps.

```javascript
it("should not lag behind mouse cursor with free highlighting", async () => {
  const { FreeOutliner, HighlightOutline } = await import("../../src/display/editor/outliner.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");

  const box = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 };
  const options = { scaleFactor: 1, thickness: 1, isLTR: true, innerMargin: 0 };

  const outliner = new FreeOutliner({ x: 10, y: 10 }, box, options.scaleFactor, options.thickness, options.isLTR, options.innerMargin);
  outliner.add({ x: 20, y: 20 });
  outliner.add({ x: 30, y: 30 });
  outliner.add({ x: 40, y: 40 });

  const outlines = outliner.getOutlines();
  const expectedOutline = new Float64Array([
    0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3,
    0.7, 0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.7, 0.7, 0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7,
    0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7, 0.7
  ]);

  const actualOutline = outlines.outline;
  expect(actualOutline).toEqual(expectedOutline);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where rendering a PDF with a lot of pages is slow. The patch provided modifies the MessageHandler class to introduce queuing and postponing of task execution. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds a queue to handle messages, postpones execution if needed, and skips cancelled tasks. This should improve performance by prioritizing message queue draining over event tasks, which might reduce rendering delays.

The test should fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a scenario where a PDF with many pages is rendered, and measure the time it takes. If it's too slow, the test fails.

I'll use the PDFDocumentProxy and PDFPageProxy from the display/api.js module. I'll load a test PDF, get the first page, and measure the time from when rendering starts until it's done. 

I'll set a timeout threshold, say 5000ms, and check if the rendering completes within that time. Before the patch, this might take longer, causing the test to fail. After the patch, it should render faster and pass.

I need to import the necessary modules dynamically. Also, I'll use a test PDF that's known to have many pages. The test will be self-contained, using async/await for promises.

So, the test structure will be: load the PDF, get the first page, measure rendering time, and assert it's within the threshold.

```javascript
it("should render PDFs with many pages quickly", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { build } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  
  // Load a test PDF with many pages
  const pdfUrl = TEST_PDFS_PATH + "pdf_with_many_pages.pdf";
  const pdf = await build(pdfUrl);
  const firstPage = await pdf.getPage(1);
  
  // Measure rendering performance
  const startTime = Date.now();
  await firstPage.render();
  const endTime = Date.now();
  const renderingTime = endTime - startTime;
  
  // The threshold is 5 seconds, but the actual time should be much less
  const timeoutThreshold = 5000;
  
  expect(renderingTime).toBeLessThan(timeoutThreshold);
});
```

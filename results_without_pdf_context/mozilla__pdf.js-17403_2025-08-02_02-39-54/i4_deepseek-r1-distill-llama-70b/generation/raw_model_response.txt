Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where rendering a PDF with a lot of pages is slow. The patch provided modifies the MessageHandler class to introduce queueing and postponing of task execution, which should improve performance by prioritizing message processing over task execution.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds properties like #cancelledStreamIds, #executorRunning, #isPostponed, and #queue to the MessageHandler. The _onComObjOnMessage method now pushes incoming messages into the queue instead of processing them immediately. The #postponeExecution method checks if tasks should be delayed, and #executor processes the queue.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a scenario where a large PDF is rendered, and the performance is measured. If the rendering is slow, the test fails; after the patch, it should render quickly.

I'll use the PDFDocumentProxy to load a test PDF with many pages. I'll measure the time it takes to render the first page. If it's below a certain threshold, the test passes.

I need to import the necessary modules. Since the test runs in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for PDFDocument and PDFPageProxy from their respective paths.

I'll set up a timeout to wait for the PDF to load and render. The timeout should be long enough to account for any delays but not too long to cause the test to hang.

After the patch, the rendering should be faster because the message queue is processed more efficiently, reducing the time taken to render the first page.

So, the test will load a large PDF, measure the render time, and assert that it's within an acceptable range. This should fail before the patch and pass after.

```javascript
it("should improve slow rendering of PDFs with many pages", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/pdf_document.js");
  const { PDFPageProxy } = await import("../../src/display/pdf_page.js");

  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/large_pdf.pdf`;
  const start = Date.now();
  const pdfDoc = await PDFDocumentLoadingTask.load(pdfPath);
  const firstPage = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
  const renderTime = Date.now() - start;

  expect(renderTime).toBeLessThan(2000);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the font size slider in the text editor isn't working smoothly. The patch provided introduces a timeout in the moveInDOM method to delay moving the editor in the DOM, which should prevent blocking the UI when changing the font size.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds a timeout to moveInDOM, so the editor doesn't move immediately but waits a bit. This should make the UI more responsive, especially when adjusting the font size with the slider.

Now, I need to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should simulate changing the font size and check if the editor's position updates correctly without blocking.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test file already imports CommandManager, I might need to import AnnotationEditor from the editor.js file.

I'll set up a test case using Jest. I'll create a mock parent object to simulate the editor's parent. The parent should have a moveEditorInDOM method that I can track.

In the test, I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditor with the mock parent. Then, I'll simulate changing the font size, which should trigger the moveInDOM method.

I'll use a spy or a mock function to check if moveEditorInDOM is called correctly. Since the patch delays the move, I'll need to wait for the timeout to ensure the method is called.

I'll structure the test with async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the timeout. After triggering the font size change, I'll wait a bit and then check if the parent's method was called as expected.

So, the test will look something like this: create the editor, trigger a font size change, wait for the timeout, and then assert that the parent's move method was called. This should ensure that the UI isn't blocked and the editor moves correctly after the delay.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external state. Also, I should only use the provided imports and avoid adding new dependencies.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's concise and directly tests the behavior fixed by the patch.

```javascript
it("should not block UI when changing font size in text editor", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  
  const mockParent = {
    moveEditorInDOM: jest.fn(),
    pageIndex: 0,
    viewport: {
      rotation: 0,
      rawDims: {
        pageWidth: 100,
        pageHeight: 100,
        pageX: 0,
        pageY: 0
      }
    }
  };

  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    parent: mockParent,
    id: "test-editor",
    uiManager: new CommandManager(),
    name: "freeText",
    isCentered: false,
    structTreeParentId: null,
    x: 10,
    y: 20
  });

  // Simulate font size change which triggers moveInDOM
  editor.fontSize = 24;

  // Use await to ensure the timeout in moveInDOM is processed
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));

  expect(mockParent.moveEditorInDOM).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

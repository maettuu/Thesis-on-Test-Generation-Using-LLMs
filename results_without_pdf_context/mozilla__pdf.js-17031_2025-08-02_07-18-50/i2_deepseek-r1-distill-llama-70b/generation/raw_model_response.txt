Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the font size slider in the text editor doesn't change easily. The patch introduces a timeout in the moveInDOM method to prevent blocking the UI. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It adds a timeout so that moveInDOM isn't called immediately; instead, it's delayed slightly. This should prevent the UI from being blocked when the font size is changed, which was the problem before.

So, the test needs to verify that after applying the patch, moving the editor in the DOM doesn't block the UI when changing the font size. 

I'll create a test that simulates changing the font size and checks if the moveInDOM method is called without blocking. Since the patch delays the move, I can check if the timeout is set correctly.

I'll use a mock editor and simulate a font size change. Then, I'll use a spy or mock to track when moveInDOM is called. If the timeout is correctly set, the moveInDOM should be delayed, allowing the UI to update without blocking.

I'll structure the test with Jest, using async/await for any asynchronous operations. I'll import the necessary modules, set up mocks for the editor and its parent, and then simulate the font size change. After that, I'll check if the moveInDOM was called after the expected delay.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond the provided imports. Also, I should ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after, confirming that the regression is fixed.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's concise and only includes the necessary steps to validate the behavior change.

```javascript
it("should not block UI when changing font size in editor", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    parent: { moveEditorInDOM: jest.fn() },
    uiManager: {},
    id: "test-editor",
    name: "test-name",
    pageIndex: 0,
    isCentered: false,
  });

  // Simulate font size change
  editor.fontSize = 24;

  // Verify that moveInDOM is called after a timeout without blocking
  expect(editor.moveInDOM).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

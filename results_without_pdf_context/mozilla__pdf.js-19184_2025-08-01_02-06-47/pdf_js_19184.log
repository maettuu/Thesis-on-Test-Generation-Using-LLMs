[2025-08-01 02:13:34] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap Extension B Character Rendering", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters using codePointAt", async () => {
    const cmap = { 0x20: "\uD840\uDC00" }; // Example Extension B character
    const toUnicodeMap = new ToUnicodeMap(cmap);

    const expected = 0x20000; // Unicode code point for the character
    let actual;

    toUnicodeMap.forEach((charCode, unicode) => {
      if (charCode == 0x20) {
        actual = unicode;
      }
    });

    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/to_unicode_map_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

[2025-08-01 02:23:25] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should correctly map Extension B characters using codePointAt", async () => {
  const { ToUnicodeMap } = await import("../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js");

  // Create a test ToUnicodeMap with an Extension B character
  const testMap = new ToUnicodeMap();
  const extensionBChar = String.fromCodePoint(0x1D11E); // Musical symbol G clef
  testMap._map['0x1D11E'] = extensionBChar;

  // Collect all mapped code points
  const actualCodePoints = [];
  testMap.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
    actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
  });

  // Check if the Extension B character is correctly mapped
  const expectedCodePoint = 0x1D11E;
  expect(actualCodePoints).toContain(expectedCodePoint);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/to_unicode_map_spec.js` file before running it.

Okay, I need to create a regression test for the bug where Extension B characters in form fields aren't rendering correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the ToUnicodeMap's forEach method to use codePointAt(0) instead of charCodeAt(0). 

First, I should understand what this change does. charCodeAt(0) returns the UTF-16 code unit, which might not correctly handle characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), like some Extension B characters. codePointAt(0) returns the full Unicode code point, which should handle these characters properly.

The test needs to verify that before the patch, the character isn't correctly retrieved, and after the patch, it is. 

I'll create a test file that imports ToUnicodeMap. Then, I'll set up a test case where a ToUnicodeMap instance has a character from Extension B. I'll create a sample map with a known key-value pair, like 0x10400 (a valid Extension B code point) mapping to the corresponding string.

In the test, I'll initialize the ToUnicodeMap with this map. Then, I'll iterate over the map using forEach and collect the values. I'll check if the correct code point is present in the collected values.

Before the patch, using charCodeAt(0) would return an incorrect value, so the test should fail. After the patch, using codePointAt(0) should return the correct value, making the test pass.

I need to structure the test using Jest or a similar framework. The test will be asynchronous, but since it's self-contained, I can use async/await for any necessary waits, though in this case, it's straightforward.

I'll import ToUnicodeMap from the correct path and set up a describe block for the regression test. Inside, an it block will handle the specific test case. I'll initialize the map, collect the code points, and assert that the expected code point is included.

I should ensure that the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and no external dependencies. The test will fail before the patch because the codePoint would be incorrect, and pass after the patch because it would be correct.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra comments or explanations.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";

describe("Regression test for Extension B characters in form fields", () => {
  it("Should correctly map Extension B characters", async () => {
    // Create a test ToUnicodeMap with a known Extension B character
    const testMap = {
      "0x10400": "\uD800\uDC00", // Represents U+10400 in UTF-16 surrogate pairs
    };
    const toUnicodeMap = new ToUnicodeMap(testMap);
    
    // Collect the actual code points from the map
    const actualCodePoints = [];
    toUnicodeMap.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
      actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
    });
    
    // The expected code point for the Extension B character
    const expectedCodePoint = 0x10400;
    
    // Check if the expected code point is present in the actual results
    expect(actualCodePoints).toContain(expectedCodePoint);
  });
});
```

Okay, I need to create a regression test for the bug where Extension B characters in form fields don't render correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the way character codes are retrieved in the ToUnicodeMap class. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original code used charCodeAt(0), which might not handle Unicode characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) correctly. The patch replaces it with codePointAt(0), which should handle all Unicode code points, including those above U+FFFF.

To create an effective test, I'll need to simulate a form field with an Extension B character and check if it's rendered correctly. I'll use the ToUnicodeMap class to map the character codes to their corresponding Unicode values.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. The ToUnicodeMap is in src/core/to_unicode_map.js, and I might need some utilities from shared/util.js.

Next, I'll set up a test suite using describe and it blocks. The describe will outline the purpose, and the it block will contain the specific test case.

In the test, I'll create a sample cmap that includes an Extension B character. For example, I can use the character 'ùÑû' (U+1D11E), which is a musical symbol. I'll add this to the cmap as a key-value pair, where the key is the character code, and the value is the string representation.

Then, I'll initialize the ToUnicodeMap with this cmap. I'll use the forEach method to iterate over the map and collect the code points. 

I'll define the expected code points and compare them with the actual results. If the patch is correct, the actual should match the expected after the change.

I need to ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after. So, I'll structure the test to check each code point accurately.

I should also make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files or dependencies beyond what's provided. All necessary data will be hardcoded into the test.

Finally, I'll write the test in JavaScript, using async functions as required by the test framework. I'll structure the code to import the necessary classes, set up the test data, run the test, and assert the expected outcomes.

```javascript
import { ToUnicodeMap } from "../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js";
import { unreachable } from "../../src/shared/util.js";

describe("ToUnicodeMap Extension B Character Rendering", () => {
  it("should correctly map Extension B characters", async () => {
    // Create a test cmap with Extension B characters
    const cmap = {
      "0": "ùÑû", // U+1D11E - MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF
      "1": "ùÖü", // U+1D11F - MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF
    };

    const toUnicodeMap = new ToUnicodeMap(Object.entries(cmap).map(([code, char]) => ({
      [code]: char,
    }));

    const expectedCodePoints = [0x1D11E, 0x1D11F];
    const actualCodePoints = [];

    toUnicodeMap.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
      actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
    });

    expect(actualCodePoints).toEqual(expectedCodePoints);
  });
});
```

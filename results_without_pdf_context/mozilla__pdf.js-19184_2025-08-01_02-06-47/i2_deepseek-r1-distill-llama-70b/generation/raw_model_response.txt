Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where Extension B characters in form fields aren't rendering correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the ToUnicodeMap's forEach method to use codePointAt(0) instead of charCodeAt(0). 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the original code was using charCodeAt(0), which returns the Unicode code point of the first character. But if the string has surrogate pairs or characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), charCodeAt might not get the correct code point. The patch changes it to codePointAt(0), which correctly handles all Unicode code points, including those beyond 16 bits.

So, the test needs to verify that after the patch, the ToUnicodeMap correctly maps characters using their full code points. 

I'll create a test that initializes a ToUnicodeMap with a cmap that includes a character from Extension B, like 'ùÑû' (MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF), which is U+1D11E. This character is represented as a surrogate pair in JavaScript strings.

In the test, I'll create a sample cmap where the key '0' maps to this character. Then, I'll use the forEach method of ToUnicodeMap to collect the mappings. I'll check if the code point for '0' is correctly 0x1D11E.

Before the patch, the test should fail because charCodeAt(0) would return the code unit of the first surrogate, which is incorrect. After the patch, it should return the correct code point.

I'll structure the test using Jest syntax. I'll import ToUnicodeMap from the correct path. Then, I'll create the cmap, initialize the map, and collect the results in an object. Finally, I'll assert that the code point for '0' is correct.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import ToUnicodeMap to ensure compatibility with Node.js.

So, the test will look something like this: create a ToUnicodeMap instance with a specific cmap, iterate over it to collect code points, and then check if the expected code point matches the actual result.

```javascript
it("should correctly map Extension B characters using code points", async () => {
  const { ToUnicodeMap } = await import("../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js");
  const cmap = { '0': "ùÑû" }; // U+1D11E MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF
  const map = new ToUnicodeMap(cmap);
  const results = {};
  
  map.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
    results[charCode] = codePoint;
  });
  
  const expectedCodePoint = 0x1D11E;
  expect(results['0']).toBe(expectedCodePoint);
});
```

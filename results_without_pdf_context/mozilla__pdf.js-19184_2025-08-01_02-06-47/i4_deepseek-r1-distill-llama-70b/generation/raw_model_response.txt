Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where Extension B characters in form fields aren't rendering correctly in the pdf.js viewer. The patch provided changes the ToUnicodeMap's forEach method to use codePointAt(0) instead of charCodeAt(0). 

First, I should understand what this change does. charCodeAt(0) returns the Unicode code point of the first character as a 16-bit number, which might not handle characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) correctly. codePointAt(0) returns the full Unicode code point, which can handle characters beyond the BMP, including those in Extension B.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that checks if the ToUnicodeMap correctly maps a character using codePointAt.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for ToUnicodeMap and any other required modules.

I'll construct a test ToUnicodeMap with a known mapping, including a high code point character, say U+1D11E (which is a musical symbol). I'll add this to the map with a key, maybe '0x1D11E'.

Next, I'll iterate over the map using forEach and collect all the mappings. I'll check if the expected code point (1D11E) is present in the collected mappings. 

Before the patch, since charCodeAt(0) was used, the code point might be incorrectly split into surrogates, causing the test to fail. After the patch, using codePointAt(0) should correctly capture the full code point, making the test pass.

I'll structure the test to create the map, collect the mappings, and assert that the expected code point is found. If it's not found, the test fails, indicating the issue still exists.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files, so I'll create the map programmatically. Also, I'll make sure to handle any potential errors or edge cases, like the map being empty or not having the expected entry.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest's it function, making it async since I'm using await for imports. I'll include the necessary imports and variables, and the assertion to check for the presence of the expected code point.

```javascript
it("should correctly map Extension B characters using codePointAt", async () => {
  const { ToUnicodeMap } = await import("../../src/core/to_unicode_map.js");
  
  // Create a test ToUnicodeMap with an Extension B character
  const testMap = new ToUnicodeMap();
  const extensionBChar = String.fromCodePoint(0x1D11E); // Musical symbol G clef
  testMap._map['0x1D11E'] = extensionBChar;

  // Collect all mapped code points
  const actualCodePoints = [];
  testMap.forEach((charCode, codePoint) => {
    actualCodePoints.push(codePoint);
  });

  // Check if the Extension B character is correctly mapped
  const expectedCodePoint = 0x1D11E;
  expect(actualCodePoints).toContain(expectedCodePoint);
});
```

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where the line and resizers around a selected editor change style. The patch provided modifies the editor.js, freetext.js, and ink.js files. The main changes are in editor.js, where they introduced a static variable _borderLineWidth and modified the initialize method to set it based on a CSS variable. They also updated the fixAndSetPosition method to adjust the position using this border width.

First, I need to understand what the test should check. The issue is about the style of the line and resizers around the selected editor. So, the test should verify that when an editor is selected, its border and resizers have the correct style, which is now influenced by the --outline-width CSS variable.

I should create a test that checks the border width of the selected editor's resizers. The test should fail before the patch because the border might not be correctly set, and pass after the patch because the width is now correctly applied.

Looking at the existing test file, it's editor_spec.js, and it imports CommandManager. I might need to import other modules like AnnotationEditor from editor.js and perhaps create a mock setup.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Import the necessary modules, including AnnotationEditor.
2. Create a mock setup where an editor is selected.
3. Check the resizer elements' border width.
4. Assert that the border width matches the expected value from the CSS variable.

I need to make sure that the test runs in a browser environment since it involves CSS styles. I'll use async/await for any promises, like initializing the editor.

In the test, I'll create a new AnnotationEditor instance, set it as selected, and then check the style of the resizer elements. The expected border width should be the same as the one set in the CSS, which the patch now correctly reads.

So, the test will look something like creating an editor, selecting it, and then checking the border width of the resizers. If the patch is applied, the width should match the CSS variable, making the test pass. Without the patch, it would fail because the width wouldn't be set correctly.

I also need to ensure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll use Jest for assertions and make sure the test is concise and focused on the specific issue.

```javascript
it("should apply the correct border width to resizers", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const editor = new AnnotationEditor({
    parent: { pageIndex: 0 },
    uiManager: {},
    id: "test-editor",
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  });
  
  editor.select();
  
  const resizer = editor.#resizersDiv.querySelector(".resizer");
  const expectedBorderWidth = 2; // Assuming --outline-width is 2px
  
  expect(getComputedStyle(resizer).borderWidth).toBe(`${expectedBorderWidth}px`);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that changes the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the patch details. The main changes are in editor.js, where they added a static property _borderLineWidth and a method #getBaseTranslation. They also modified the fixAndSetPosition method to adjust the position based on the border width.

So, the test should check if the border width is correctly applied, affecting the positioning of the editor. 

I'll create a test case where an editor is created, and after calling fixAndSetPosition, I'll check the styles applied to the div and the resizer elements. The resizers are the small circles at the corners.

I'll import the necessary classes: AnnotationEditor from editor.js and FreeTextEditor from freetext.js since it's a subclass. 

I'll set up a mock viewport to simulate the page dimensions and rotation. Then, I'll create a FreeTextEditor instance with specific dimensions and position.

After initializing, I'll call fixAndSetPosition to apply the patch changes. Then, I'll check the left and top styles of the editor's div to ensure they're correctly adjusted based on the border width.

Also, I'll check the resizer elements' styles to make sure their border properties are set correctly, using rgba values as per the CSS variables.

I'll structure the test with async/await, using dynamic imports to load the modules. I'll set up the expectations based on the CSS variables and compare them against the actual styles applied after the patch.

This should cover both the line style and resizer styles, ensuring the regression is properly addressed.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor position accounting for border width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("./editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("./freetext.js");

  // Mock viewport with known dimensions and rotation
  const viewport = {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    rotation: 0,
  };

  // Create editor with initial position
  const editor = new FreeTextEditor({
    parent: {
      viewport,
      pageIndex: 0,
    },
    id: "test-editor",
    x: 10,
    y: 20,
    width: 30,
    height: 40,
    uiManager: {},
    isCentered: false,
  });

  // Initialize the editor
  editor.initialize();

  // Apply the fix and set the position
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  // Check the styles applied to the editor div
  const style = editor.div.style;
  expect(style.left).toBe("10.00%");
  expect(style.top).toBe("20.00%");
});

it("should adjust resizer positions accounting for border width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("./editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("./freetext.js");

  // Mock viewport with known dimensions and rotation
  const viewport = {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    rotation: 0,
  };

  // Create editor with initial position
  const editor = new FreeTextEditor({
    parent: {

    isCentered: false,
  });

  // Initialize the editor
  editor.initialize();

  // Apply the fix and set the position
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  // Check the styles applied to the resizer elements
  const resizers = editor.div.querySelectorAll(".resizer");
  resizers.forEach(resizer => {
    const border = window.getComputedStyle(resizer).border;
    expect(border).toMatch(/rgba\(0, 0, 0, 0.5\) solid (\d+\.?\d*)px/);
  });
});

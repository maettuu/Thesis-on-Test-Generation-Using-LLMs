Okay, so I need to write a test that checks if the patch correctly changes the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor. The patch involves modifying the editor.js file to adjust the line width based on a CSS variable.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds a static variable _borderLineWidth to the AnnotationEditor class. This variable is initialized in the static initialize method by reading a CSS variable --outline-width from the document's style. Then, it uses this value in the fixAndSetPosition method to adjust the position based on the border width.

So, the test needs to verify that when the editor is initialized, the border line width is correctly read from the CSS, and the position is adjusted accordingly.

I'll need to mock or set the CSS variable to a specific value. Let's say I set it to 2px. Then, when the editor is initialized, it should read this value. The test will check if the _borderLineWidth is set correctly and if the position adjustment uses this value.

I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditor, but since it's an abstract class, I might need to extend it. Alternatively, I can test it through one of its subclasses, but for simplicity, I'll create a mock subclass.

In the test, I'll set up the CSS variable, create an editor instance, and then check if the static _borderLineWidth is set to the expected value. Also, I'll verify that the position calculation includes the border adjustment.

I should also ensure that the test fails before the patch is applied. Without the patch, the _borderLineWidth would be -1, so the position adjustment wouldn't occur. After the patch, the value should be correct, and the position should reflect the adjustment.

So, the test will import the necessary files, set up the CSS variable, create an editor, and assert the expected values.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor position based on border line width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  
  // Mock the CSS variable
  const mockGetComputedStyle = {
    getPropertyValue: () => "2px"
  };
  const originalGetComputedStyle = window.getComputedStyle;
  window.getComputedStyle = () => mockGetComputedStyle;

  // Initialize the editor
  class TestEditor extends AnnotationEditor {}
  TestEditor.initialize({});

  // Verify the border line width is correctly read
  const expectedBorderWidth = 2;
  const actualBorderWidth = AnnotationEditor._borderLineWidth;
  expect(actualBorderWidth).toBe(expectedBorderWidth);

  // Test position adjustment
  const editor = new TestEditor({/* required params */});
  const [parentWidth, parentHeight] = [100, 100]; // Mock parent dimensions
  const [tx, ty] = [10, 10]; // Mock translation
  
  // Calculate expected position
  const expectedX = tx - (expectedBorderWidth / parentWidth);
  const expectedY = ty - (expectedBorderWidth / parentHeight);
  
  // Get actual position
  const actualX = editor.x;
  const actualY = editor.y;
  
  expect(actualX).toBeCloseTo(expectedX);
  expect(actualY).toBeCloseTo(expectedY);

  // Cleanup
  window.getComputedStyle = originalGetComputedStyle;
});

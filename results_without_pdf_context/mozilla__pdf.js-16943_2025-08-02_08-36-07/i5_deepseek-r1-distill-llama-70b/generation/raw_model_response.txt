Okay, I need to write a regression test for the patch that changes the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the patch details. The main changes are in editor.js where the static method initialize is updated to calculate the border line width. Also, the setposition method now adjusts the position based on this border width.

So, the test should check if the editor's position is correctly adjusted after the patch. I'll need to create an instance of an editor, set its position, and then check if the styles applied match the expected values considering the border width.

I'll use the FreeTextEditor since it's a subclass of AnnotationEditor. I'll import the necessary modules, set up a sample document and page, create an editor instance, and initialize it.

Next, I'll set the editor's position and check the left and top styles. Before the patch, these values wouldn't account for the border, so the test would fail. After the patch, the positions should include the adjustment, making the test pass.

I'll structure the test with Jest, using async/await for imports. I'll also mock the getComputedStyle to return a specific border width for consistency.

Finally, I'll write the test to compare the expected and actual styles, ensuring that the patch correctly applies the border adjustments.

```javascript
it("should adjust editor position accounting for border line width", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/freetext.js");
  
  // Mock getComputedStyle to return a specific outline width
  const mockGetComputedStyle = {
    getPropertyValue: () => "--outline-width: 2px"
  };
  global.getComputedStyle = jest.fn(() => mockGetComputedStyle);

  // Initialize the editor
  FreeTextEditor.initialize(new Map());
  await AnnotationEditor.initialize(new Map());

  // Create a test editor instance
  const editor = new FreeTextEditor();
  editor.parentDimensions = [100, 100]; // Parent dimensions in pixels
  editor.pageDimensions = [100, 100]; // Page dimensions in pixels
  editor.rotation = 0; // No rotation for this test

  // Set the position and check the style
  editor.x = 0.5;
  editor.y = 0.5;
  editor.setPosition();

  // Get the computed style
  const style = editor.div.style;

  // Expected values considering border line width
  const expectedLeft = (0.5 + (2/100)).toFixed(2);
  const expectedTop = (0.5 + (2/100)).toFixed(2);

  expect(style.left).toBe(expectedLeft + "%");
  expect(style.top).toBe(expectedTop + "%");
});
```

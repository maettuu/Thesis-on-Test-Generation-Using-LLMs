Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the style of the line and resizers around a selected editor should change. The patch provided makes some changes to the editor.js, freetext.js, and ink.js files. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Looking at the changes, in editor.js, they added a static property _borderLineWidth and a method #getBaseTranslation. They also modified the fixAndSetPosition method to adjust the position based on the border line width. 

The test needs to ensure that before the patch, the resizers didn't have the correct style, and after the patch, they do. So I need to simulate selecting an editor and check the resizers' styles.

I'll start by importing the necessary classes. Since the test is in unit/editor_spec.js, I can import AnnotationEditor from '../../src/display/editor/editor.js' and FreeTextEditor from '../../src/display/editor/freetext.js'.

I'll create a test case where I set up a FreeTextEditor instance. I need to mock the viewport to get the page dimensions and rotation. Then, I'll call fixAndSetPosition to apply the patch changes.

Before the patch, the resizer elements wouldn't have the correct border width. So in the test, I'll check if the resizer elements have the expected border style after the patch is applied.

I'll write an async test block. Inside, I'll create a FreeTextEditor instance with some parameters. I'll set the viewport with specific dimensions and rotation. Then, I'll call fixAndSetPosition to trigger the changes.

After that, I'll query the resizer elements. Since the patch adds a 1px solid border, I'll check if the style matches. 

I should make sure that the test only checks the necessary conditions without overcomplicating. Also, I need to handle any setup or teardown if needed, but in this case, it's a simple check.

So, putting it all together, the test will create an editor, apply the patch's functionality, and assert that the resizers have the correct border style.

```javascript
it("should change resizer and line style when editor is selected", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/editor.js");
  const { FreeTextEditor } = await import("../../src/display/editor/freetext.js");
  
  // Setup editor with specific dimensions and rotation
  const editor = new FreeTextEditor({
    parent: {
      viewport: {
        rotation: 0,
        pageWidth: 100,
        pageHeight: 100,
        pageX: 0,
        pageY: 0
      }
    },
    x: 10,
    y: 20,
    id: "test-editor",
    uiManager: {}
  });

  // Apply the fix and set position to trigger the style changes
  editor.fixAndSetPosition();

  // Query the resizer elements and verify their styles
  const resizers = editor.div.querySelectorAll('.resizer');
  expect(resizers.length).toBe(4);

  const expectedBorder = '1px solid rgb(255, 0, 0)';
  for (const resizer of resizers) {
    expect(resizer.style.border).toBe(expectedBorder);
  }
});
```

Alright, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the JPX fuzzer was spamming logs with "OpenJPEG: Unknown format". The patch provided modifies the decode function in jpx.js to throw a JpxError with the message from the OpenJPEG module instead of a generic message. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, when decode failed, it threw a JpxError with the message "JPX decode failed". Now, it checks if imageData is a string, which probably contains the error message from OpenJPEG, like "Unknown format", and throws that instead.

So, the test needs to verify that when a failure occurs, the error message is the specific one from OpenJPEG, not the generic one. 

I'll use a test file that causes OpenJPEG to fail. I remember there's a test file called "invalid_jpx.jpx" that can be used for this purpose. 

In the test, I'll import JpxImage and attempt to decode this invalid file. I'll wrap the decode call in a try-catch block. Before the patch, the error message would be "JPX decode failed", but after the patch, it should be "Unknown format".

I need to structure the test so that it fails before the patch and passes after. So, the test will expect the specific error message. If the patch is applied correctly, the test should pass because the error message will match.

I should make sure to import the necessary modules and handle any setup or teardown if needed. Since this is a self-contained test, I'll keep it simple with just the try-catch and the assertion.

I also need to ensure that the test is async because the decode function might be asynchronous, especially if it's using external modules like OpenJPEG.

Putting it all together, the test will attempt to decode an invalid JPX file, catch the error, and check that the message is "Unknown format".

```javascript
it("should throw specific error message when decoding invalid JPX", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const invalidJpxData = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]); // Invalid JPX data
  
  try {
    await JpxImage.decode(invalidJpxData, false);
    throw new Error("Expected JpxError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof JpxError) {
      const expectedMessage = "Unknown format";
      expect(error.message).toBe(`JPX error: ${expectedMessage}`);
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the JPX fuzzer was spamming logs with "OpenJPEG: Unknown format". The patch changes the decode method to throw a JpxError with the message from OpenJPEG instead of a generic one. 

First, I should figure out how to test this. The goal is to ensure that when the decode method fails, it throws an error with the correct message from OpenJPEG, not the generic one.

Looking at the code before the patch, the decode method throws "JPX decode failed" regardless of the error. After the patch, it should throw the specific error message from OpenJPEG, like "Unknown format".

So, the test should do the following:
1. Provide an invalid input that triggers the OpenJPEG error.
2. Call the decode method and catch the error.
3. Check that the error message matches the expected one from OpenJPEG.

I'll need to import JpxImage and JpxError. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports.

I'll create a test case that uses an invalid buffer. The decode method should throw a JpxError with the message "Unknown format". 

I'll structure the test with an async function, import the necessary modules, and use expect to check the error message.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files, so using a small invalid buffer is appropriate.

Finally, the test should pass after the patch because the error message will be correct, and fail before because it would have the generic message.

```javascript
it("should throw JpxError with OpenJPEG error message", async () => {
  const { JpxImage, JpxError } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const invalidData = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]); // Invalid JPX data

  const error = await JpxImage.decode(invalidData, false).catch((error) => {
    return error;
  });

  expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(JpxError);
  expect(error.message).toBe("Unknown format");
});
```

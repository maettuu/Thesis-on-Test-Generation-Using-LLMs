Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the console error about failing to load a module script is resolved by the patch provided. The error occurs when importing the PDF worker as an ES module in the browser. 

First, I'll look at the issue details. The problem is that when using `await import("https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/build/pdf.worker.mjs");`, the server responds with an empty MIME type, causing the browser to throw an error because it expects a JavaScript module script. 

The patch modifies the `createObjectURL` call to include the MIME type as `text/javascript`. This should fix the issue because the blob will now have the correct MIME type, allowing the browser to recognize it as a JavaScript module.

So, the test needs to verify that importing the worker with the correct MIME type doesn't throw an error. 

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create a blob with the worker code, create an object URL with the correct MIME type, and then import it. If the import succeeds without throwing an error, the test passes.

I'll use `fetch` to get the worker content, create a blob, and then use `URL.createObjectURL` with the `type` set to `text/javascript`. Then, I'll use `await import` to load the worker and check if it's defined.

I need to ensure that the test runs in a browser environment since Node.js doesn't handle blobs and object URLs the same way. Also, I'll make sure to clean up the object URL after the test to avoid memory leaks.

So, the test will fetch the worker script, create a blob with the correct MIME type, import it, and assert that the worker is loaded correctly. If the import doesn't throw an error, the test passes, confirming the fix works.

```javascript
it("should load module script with correct MIME type", async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/build/pdf.worker.mjs");
  const blob = new Blob([await response.text()], { type: "text/javascript" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  try {
    const worker = await import(url);
    expect(worker).toBeDefined();
  } finally {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  }
});
```

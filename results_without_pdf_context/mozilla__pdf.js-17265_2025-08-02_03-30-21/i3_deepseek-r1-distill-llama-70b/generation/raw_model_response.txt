Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a console error occurs when loading a PDF worker script. The error is about the MIME type being incorrect, causing the module script to fail. 

First, I'll look at the problem. The error happens because the worker script is being loaded without the correct MIME type. The patch adds the MIME type when creating the Blob for the worker script. So, the test should check if this MIME type is correctly set after the patch.

I'll start by examining the existing test file provided. It imports necessary modules and has some setup. I can reuse these imports and structure.

I need to create a test that attempts to load a worker and checks for the MIME type. I'll use a spy or some method to intercept the Blob creation and check its type.

In the test, I'll create a worker using the PDFWorker class. Then, I'll set up a spy on URL.createObjectURL to capture the Blob and check its type. 

I'll use Jest to write the test. I'll mock the URL.createObjectURL method to return a blob URL and check if the Blob's type is 'text/javascript'. 

So, the steps are:
1. Import necessary modules.
2. Mock the createObjectURL function to track the Blob.
3. Create a worker instance which triggers the Blob creation.
4. Check if the Blob's type is correct.
5. Clean up the mocks.

I'll structure the test using Jest's async/await syntax and ensure it fails without the patch and passes with it.

```javascript
it("should load worker scripts with correct MIME type", async () => {
  const originalCreateObjectURL = URL.createObjectURL;
  let blobType;

  // Mock createObjectURL to capture the Blob type
  URL.createObjectURL = (blob) => {
    blobType = blob.type;
    return originalCreateObjectURL(blob);
  };

  try {
    const worker = new PDFWorker();
    await worker.promise;

    expect(blobType).toBe('text/javascript');
  } finally {
    URL.createObjectURL = originalCreateObjectURL;
  }
});
```

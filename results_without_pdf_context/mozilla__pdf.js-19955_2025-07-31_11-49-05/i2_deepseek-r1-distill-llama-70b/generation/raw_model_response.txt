Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF with a Type3 font missing the FontName entry in the FontDescriptor wasn't rendering the text layer. The patch is supposed to fix this by providing a fallback FontName.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user provided a PDF where selecting text didn't generate a text layer because the font wasn't loading correctly. The warnings indicated issues with the font name. The patch modifies the evaluator.js to handle cases where FontDescriptor is present but lacks FontName for Type3 fonts.

So, the test should check if the text layer is generated correctly after the patch. I'll need to create a test that uses a PDF that triggers this issue. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, like PDFDocument and TextLayerBuilder. Then, I'll load the problematic PDF. If the text layer is generated, the test passes.

I'll set up the test to load the PDF and attempt to build the text layer. If it throws an error, the test fails. But after the patch, it should build without issues.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll use dynamic imports for compatibility with Node.js.

So, the test will look like this: load the PDF, try to get the first page, build the text layer, and check if it's generated. If it is, the test passes.

I'll write the test in a way that it directly tests the scenario addressed by the patch, ensuring it's to the point and doesn't include unnecessary steps.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for Type3 fonts with missing FontName in FontDescriptor", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { TextLayerBuilder } = await import("../../src/display/text_layer_builder.js");

  // The PDF in question has a Type3 font with missing FontName in FontDescriptor
  const pdfData = await fetch("path/to/Capital.Bancorp.Inc.Corporate.Responsibility.2025509.SD000000003063823863-1-2.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load({ data: pdfData });

  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textLayer = await TextLayerBuilder.getTextLayer({
    textItem: page.getTextContent(),
    container: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 }),
    viewport: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 }),
    includeLogicalSize: true
  });

  expect(textLayer).toBeTruthy();
});
```

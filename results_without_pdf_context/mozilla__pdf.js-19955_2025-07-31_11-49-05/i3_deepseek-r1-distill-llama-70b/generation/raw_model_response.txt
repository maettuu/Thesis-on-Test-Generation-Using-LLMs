Okay, I need to write a test that verifies the fix for the issue where the PDF's text layer wasn't generating because of a font issue. The user provided a patch that modifies the evaluator.js file, specifically handling cases where the font descriptor might be missing or invalid, especially for Type3 fonts.

First, I should understand the problem. The user's PDF has a missing text layer because the font loading was failing due to an invalid font name. The patch changes how the font descriptor is handled, ensuring that a valid font name is set even when it's missing, which should allow the text layer to render correctly.

So, the test needs to simulate this scenario. I'll create a test PDF that triggers this issue. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll create an in-memory PDF using the provided classes.

I'll set up a mock XRef and define the necessary objects. The PDF should have a font dictionary that's missing the FontName or has an invalid one, which would cause the issue before the patch. After applying the patch, the evaluator should handle this case gracefully.

In the test, I'll create a font dictionary without a FontName. Then, I'll create a PartialEvaluator and attempt to load the font. Without the patch, this should throw an error, but with the patch, it should not throw and should handle the missing FontName by creating a default one.

I'll use Jest's async/await syntax to handle the promises. The test will check that the font loading doesn't throw an error, indicating that the patch works.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll import the necessary classes like Dict, Name, PartialEvaluator, etc., and set up the mock data correctly.

Finally, the test will assert that the evaluator can handle the missing FontName without throwing an error, confirming the fix.

```javascript
it("should handle missing FontName in Type3 fonts", async () => {
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const fontDict = new Dict();
  fontDict.set("Type", new Name("Font"));
  fontDict.set("Subtype", new Name("Type3"));
  fontDict.set("FontBBox", [0, 0, 0, 0]);
  fontDict.set("FontMatrix", [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]);

  xref.put(1, fontDict);

  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: {
      send: () => {},
      sendWithPromise: () => Promise.resolve(),
    },
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: new Map(),
    builtInCMapCache: new Map(),
    standardFontDataCache: new Map(),
    globalColorSpaceCache: new Map(),
    systemFontCache: new Map(),
    options: {},
  });

  await expect(
    evaluator.loadFont(
      "missing",
      { objId: { ref: 1 } },
      null,
      new WorkerTask(),
      null,
      null
    )
  ).resolves.not.toThrow(FormatError);
});
```

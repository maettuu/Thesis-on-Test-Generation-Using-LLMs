Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the regression issue is fixed by the provided patch. The issue is that the PDF isn't generating a text layer because of a font problem, but after the patch, it should work.

First, I should understand the problem. The user mentioned that when they open the PDF and try to select text, it doesn't generate a text layer. The error logs point to issues with font loading, specifically an invalid font name. The patch modifies the evaluator.js file, adjusting how fonts are handled, especially for Type3 fonts.

So, the test needs to verify that after applying the patch, the text layer is correctly generated. I'll use the provided PDF file to test this.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll need to import the necessary modules, like `PDFDocument` and `PDFPage`, and use `fetch` to get the PDF data. Then, I'll load the PDF, get the first page, and check if the text layer is generated without errors.

I'll wrap this in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions. If the text layer is successfully created, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external dependencies beyond what's provided. Also, I should dynamically import the necessary modules to maintain compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test to ensure that after the patch, the text layer is generated without throwing an error related to invalid font names or missing text layers.

```javascript
it("should generate text layer for PDF with problematic font", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const pdfBytes = await fetch("https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20281525/Capital.Bancorp.Inc.Corporate.Responsibility.2025509.SD000000003063823863-1-2.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfBytes);
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  
  try {
    await page.getTextContent();
    expect(true).toBeTruthy();
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error.message).not.toMatch(/invalid font name/);
  }
});
```

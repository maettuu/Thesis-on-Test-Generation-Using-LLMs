Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where only supported image types should be allowed when selecting an image in the stamp annotation. The patch adds a list of supported types and sets the input's accept attribute to StampEditor.supportedTypes. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, the input accepted "image/*", which allows all image types. Now, it's restricted to specific MIME types. So the test needs to verify that after the patch, only these supported types are accepted.

I'll create a test file. I'll need to import the necessary modules. From the imports provided, I can use "../../shared/util.js" for AnnotationEditorType and shadow, and "../../display/editor/stamp.js" for StampEditor.

The test suite will be called "StampEditor" and the test case will check if the supported types are correctly set. 

In the test, I'll create an instance of StampEditor. Then, I'll get the supportedTypes by accessing StampEditor.supportedTypes. I'll split this string into an array and check that each expected type is present.

I'll define the expected types as per the patch: apng, avif, bmp, gif, jpeg, png, svg+xml, webp, x-icon. I'll loop through each and ensure they're included in the supported array.

If any expected type is missing, the test should fail. If all are present, it passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I won't rely on any external data. The test will run in an async function since the StampEditor might have async initializations, but in this case, it's straightforward.

So, putting it all together, the test imports the necessary modules, sets up the test suite, and checks each supported type against the expected list.

```javascript
import { AnnotationEditorType, shadow } from "../../shared/util.js";
import { StampEditor } from "../../display/editor/stamp.js";

describe("StampEditor", () => {
  it("should only accept supported image types", async () => {
    const editor = new StampEditor({ bitmapUrl: "" });
    const supportedTypes = StampEditor.supportedTypes.split(",").map(type => type.trim());
    
    const expectedTypes = [
      "image/apng",
      "image/avif",
      "image/bmp",
      "image/gif",
      "image/jpeg",
      "image/png",
      "image/svg+xml",
      "image/webp",
      "image/x-icon"
    ];
    
    expectedTypes.forEach(type => {
      expect(supportedTypes).toContain(type);
    });
  });
});
```

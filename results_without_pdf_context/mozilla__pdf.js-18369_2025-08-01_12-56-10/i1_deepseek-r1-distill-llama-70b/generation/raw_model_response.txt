Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where opening a PDF in Firefox shows Japanese vertical punctuation errors. The patch provided is supposed to fix this, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds a function getVerticalPresentationForm in fonts_utils.js which maps certain Unicode characters to their vertical forms. Then, in fonts.js, when a font is missing and it's vertical, it replaces the character with its vertical form if available.

So the test needs to check if a PDF with vertical Japanese punctuation renders correctly. I'll need a sample PDF that includes these characters. Maybe I can use an existing test PDF or create one. Since I don't have one, I'll assume there's a test file called 'vertical_punctuation.pdf' in the TEST_PDFS_PATH.

The test should open this PDF, render a page, and check if the text includes the expected vertical characters. If before the patch, the text was incorrect, after the patch, it should be correct.

I'll structure the test using the existing imports. I'll import getDocument from the API and use the test setup to load the PDF. Then, I'll render the first page and extract the text. I'll check for specific vertical punctuation, like the vertical full stop (、) or comma (、).

I need to make sure the test is self-contained. I'll use the TEST_PDFS_PATH to load the PDF. The test will have two parts: one that expects the text to include the correct punctuation after the patch.

Wait, but how do I know what the incorrect text was before the patch? Maybe before, the vertical punctuation was rendered as horizontal or some other incorrect form. So the test will look for the correct Unicode characters in the text output.

I'll write the test to fetch the PDF, get the first page, render it, and then check if the text includes the expected vertical punctuation. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I should also handle any potential errors, like the PDF not loading correctly, but since it's a test, I can assume the PDF is available.

So, putting it all together, the test will import the necessary modules, load the PDF, render the page, extract the text, and assert that the text contains the expected vertical punctuation.

```javascript
it("should correctly render vertical Japanese punctuation", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/vertical_punctuation.pdf`;
  
  const params = buildGetDocumentParams(pdfPath, WORKER_SRC);
  const document = await PDFDocumentLoadingTask.create(params).promise;
  const proxy = new PDFDocumentProxy(document);
  
  const page = await proxy.getPage(1);
  const text = await page.getTextContent();
  
  // Check for vertical punctuation like、。、「」 etc.
  const expectedPunctuation = [",", "。", "「", "」"];
  const hasVerticalPunctuation = expectedPunctuation.every(p => text.items.some(item => item.str.includes(p)));
  
  expect(hasVerticalPunctuation).toBe(true);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a read-only form field isn't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the provided code and the patch. The problem is in the TextWidgetAnnotationElement's constructor. The isRenderable variable wasn't considering hasOwnCanvas, so the element wasn't rendered.

I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll import the necessary modules, like getDocument and PDFWorker, using the provided paths. Then, I'll set the AnnotationMode to 1.

Next, I'll load the specific PDF file, simple-form-readonly.pdf, which triggers the issue. I'll get the first page and render it, then check if the text element is correctly rendered.

I'll create a function to check the element's presence. Using a timeout to allow rendering, I'll look for the text widget element. If it's found, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only tests this specific behavior. I'll structure it as an async function with try-catch blocks to handle any errors during setup or rendering.

Finally, I'll write the test block, ensuring it uses the correct imports and setup. This test should fail before the patch because the element isn't rendered and pass after the patch is applied.

```javascript
it("should render read-only form field when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { PDFWorker } = await import("../../src/display/worker.js");
  const { TEST_PDFS_PATH } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}simple-form-readonly.pdf`;
  const pdfDoc = await getDocument({
    url: pdfPath,
    worker: new PDFWorker(),
    annotationMode: AnnotationMode.ENABLED,
  });

  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
  const renderTask = page.render({
    viewport,
    annotationMode: AnnotationMode.ENABLED,
  });

  let textElementRendered = false;
  
  function checkTextElement() {
    const textWidget = document.querySelector('.textWidgetAnnotation');
    if (textWidget && textWidget.textContent === "Foo") {
      textElementRendered = true;
    }
  }

  // Give the rendering a chance to complete
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      checkTextElement();
      if (textElementRendered) {
        clearInterval(interval);
        resolve();
      }
    }, 100);
  });

  assert.ok(textElementRendered, "Read-only form field is rendered correctly");
});

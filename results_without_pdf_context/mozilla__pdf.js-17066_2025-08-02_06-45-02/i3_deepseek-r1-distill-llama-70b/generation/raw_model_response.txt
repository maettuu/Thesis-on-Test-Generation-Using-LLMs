Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where a read-only form field isn't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The user provided a patch that modifies the TextWidgetAnnotationElement's constructor to include an additional condition for isRenderable. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The patch adds a condition to check if the field has its own canvas. So, the isRenderable property is now true if either renderForms is true, the field has its own canvas, or it doesn't have an appearance but has a field value.

The test needs to verify that before the patch, the read-only field isn't rendered, and after the patch, it is rendered correctly. 

I'll start by setting up the test environment. I'll need to import necessary modules like getDocument from the display API and the TEST_PDFS_PATH from test_utils. I'll also need to handle the PDF loading and page rendering.

I'll use the provided test PDFs: simple-form-readonly.pdf. I'll load the PDF document, get the first page, and render it with the AnnotationMode set to 1 (ENABLED).

I'll create a function to check if the text field is rendered. This function will look for the textWidgetAnnotation elements and check if they have the correct properties, like being visible and having the expected text.

Before the patch, when AnnotationMode is ENABLED, the field shouldn't render. So, I'll set up the test to expect that the field is not rendered. After applying the patch, the same test should show the field rendered correctly.

I'll structure the test with two cases: one before the patch and one after. But since I can only write one test block, I'll focus on the scenario after the patch to ensure it works. Alternatively, I can write a test that simulates both scenarios, but given the constraints, I'll write a test that assumes the patch is applied and checks if the field is rendered.

Wait, no. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. So, in the test, I'll set up the scenario where the field should be rendered when the patch is applied. The test will check if the element exists and has the correct properties.

I'll use Jest's async/await for handling the asynchronous operations. I'll also need to ensure that the test doesn't leak any variables or state between tests.

So, the test will:

1. Load the PDF document.
2. Get the first page and render it with AnnotationMode set to 1.
3. Check if the text field element exists and has the expected value and visibility.

I'll write the test using the provided imports and structure it within an it block. The test will fail before the patch because the field isn't rendered, and pass after the patch because the field is now rendered.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and not introducing new dependencies. I'll also handle any necessary cleanup, like closing the PDF document after the test.

Finally, I'll write the JavaScript code for the test, ensuring it's concise and to the point, only testing the specific regression case.

```javascript
it("should render read-only form fields when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { PDFDocumentProxy } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}simple-form-readonly.pdf`;
  const params = buildGetDocumentParams(pdfPath, {
    cMapUrl: CMAP_URL,
    rangeChunkSize: 1,
  });

  const pdf = await getDocument(params);
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewPort({ scale: 1 });
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  const annotationMode = AnnotationMode.ENABLED;

  const renderForms = true;

  await page.render({
    ...viewport,
    annotationMode,
    div,
    renderForms,
  });

  const textWidget = div.querySelector(".textWidgetAnnotation");
  const textContent = textWidget.querySelector("div");
  expect(textWidget).toBeTruthy();
  expect(textContent?.textContent).toBe("Foo");
});
```

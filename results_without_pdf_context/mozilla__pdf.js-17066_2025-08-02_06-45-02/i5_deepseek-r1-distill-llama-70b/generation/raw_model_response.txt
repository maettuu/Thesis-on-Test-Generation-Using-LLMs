Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a read-only form field isn't rendered when AnnotationMode is set to ENABLED (1). The patch modifies the isRenderable condition in TextWidgetAnnotationElement. 

First, I should understand the problem. The issue occurs when AnnotationMode is 1, which sets renderForms to false. The text field isn't displayed because isRenderable is false. The patch adds a condition to check if the field has its own canvas, which might be why it's now renderable.

So, the test needs to check both before and after the patch. But since the test will run after the patch, I need to simulate both scenarios. 

I'll create a test that loads a PDF with a read-only text field. I'll set AnnotationMode to 1 and check if the text field is rendered. Before the patch, this would fail, but after, it should pass.

I'll use PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load the test PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and its annotation layer. I'll look for the text widget and check if it's rendered by seeing if its element exists in the DOM.

I'll use the provided test PDF, simple-form-readonly.pdf, which has the read-only field. After setting up the page and annotations, I'll check if the text element is present. If it is, the test passes.

I need to import necessary modules like PDFDocument, PDFPage, and AnnotationLayer. I'll structure the test with async/await for loading the PDF and page.

So, the test will:
1. Import the PDF document.
2. Set AnnotationMode to 1.
3. Get the first page and its annotations.
4. Find the text widget.
5. Check if the element exists and has the correct value.

This should ensure that after the patch, the read-only field is rendered correctly.

```javascript
it("should render read-only text form field when AnnotationMode is ENABLED", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { PDFPage } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { AnnotationLayer } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  
  // Load test PDF with read-only form field
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load await import("./simple-form-readonly.pdf");
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const annotations = await page.getAnnotations();
  const annotationLayer = new AnnotationLayer({
    page,
    annotations,
    parameters: {
      renderForms: false,
      annotationMode: 1,
      enableScripting: false
    }
  });

  // Create the DOM elements
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  annotationLayer.render(div);

  // Get the text widget element
  const textElement = annotationLayer._elements[0];

  // The text field should be rendered and have the correct value
  expect(textElement).toBeTruthy();
  expect(textElement.textContent).toBe("Foo");
});
```

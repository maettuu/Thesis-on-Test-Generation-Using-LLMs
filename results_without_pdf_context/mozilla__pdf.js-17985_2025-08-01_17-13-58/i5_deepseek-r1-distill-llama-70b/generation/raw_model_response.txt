Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where OpenJPEG warnings don't respect the PDF.js verbosity levels. The patch provided modifies the JpxImage.decode method to pass the warn function from PDF.js, so I should test if warnings are now properly handled according to the verbosity setting.

First, I'll set up a test that checks if console.warn is called when it should be. I'll import the necessary modules, like JpxImage and the warn function from '../shared/util.js'.

I'll create a test image using OpenJPEG that triggers a warning. I'll set the verbosity level to 'error' so that warnings should be suppressed. Then, I'll call JpxImage.decode with the test data and check if console.warn is not called.

I'll use a spy on console.warn to track if it's called. Since the decode method is asynchronous, I'll use await and make the test function async.

After applying the patch, the test should pass because the warnings will use the PDF.js warn function, which respects the verbosity level. Before the patch, console.warn would have been called directly, causing the test to fail.

I'll structure the test with Jest syntax, using it and expect with toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0) to ensure no warnings are logged when verbosity is set to error.

```javascript
it("should respect verbosity level when logging OpenJPEG warnings", async () => {
  const { JpxImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpx.js");
  const { warn } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  
  // Mock console.warn to track warnings
  const mockWarn = jest.spyOn(console, 'warn').mockImplementation(() => {});

  // Set verbosity level to 'error' which should suppress warnings
  setVerbosityLevel('error');

  // Test data that triggers an OpenJPEG warning
  const testData = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0x6f, 0x62, 0x6a, 0x01, 0x00]); // Minimal JPX file

  // Decode should not trigger a warning due to verbosity level
  await JpxImage.decode(testData);

  // Verify that console.warn was not called
  expect(mockWarn).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  // Cleanup
  mockWarn.mockRestore();
});
```

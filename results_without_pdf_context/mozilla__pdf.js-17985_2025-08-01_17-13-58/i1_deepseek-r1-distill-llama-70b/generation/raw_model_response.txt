Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where OpenJPEG warnings don't respect the PDF.js verbosity levels. The patch provided modifies the JpxImage.decode method to pass the warn function from util.js to OpenJPEG. So, the test should check if warnings are logged correctly based on the verbosity level.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It imports the necessary modules, including JpxImage and utilities like getVerbosityLevel and setVerbosityLevel. I can reuse these imports.

The test should simulate a scenario where a warning is triggered. I'll create a test image that causes OpenJPEG to emit a warning. Then, I'll set the verbosity level to QUIET to see if the warning is not logged, and then to DEBUG to ensure it is logged.

I'll use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions. If no warning is thrown when verbosity is DEBUG, the test should fail. Conversely, when verbosity is QUIET, no warning should be thrown.

I'll structure the test with two cases: one with QUIET level and another with DEBUG. I'll use async/await since the decode method is asynchronous.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll include all necessary imports within the test block. I'll also generate a sample JPX data that triggers the warning, perhaps by passing invalid data.

Finally, I'll write the test to fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the OpenJPEG warnings respect the verbosity settings.

Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key doesn't delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of shortcuts in the AnnotationEditorUIManager. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch is adding support for the Delete key on macOS. Before the patch, only "Delete", "ctrl+Delete", and "shift+Delete" were handled, but not the macOS equivalent, which is probably Cmd+Delete.

So, the test needs to simulate pressing the Delete key on macOS and check if the selected annotation gets deleted. The test should fail before the patch because the shortcut isn't handled, and pass after the patch because it is handled.

I'll use the test utilities provided. I'll import the necessary modules like AnnotationEditorUIManager and CommandManager from the correct paths. 

I'll set up a test PDF document and create an annotation. Then, I'll select this annotation. Next, I'll simulate the keyboard event for 'mac+Delete' using the sendKeys method. After that, I'll check if the annotation still exists in the storage. If it's deleted, the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll structure the test with async/await for proper asynchronous handling.

So, the test will import the necessary classes, set up the document and annotation, simulate the key press, and assert that the annotation is removed. This should cover the scenario and validate the patch's effectiveness.

```javascript
it("should delete selected annotation when pressing Delete key on macOS", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager, CommandManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { PDFDocument, Page } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const { Annotation, AnnotationStorage } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_storage.js");

  // Setup test document and annotation
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = new Page(pdf, 1);
  const annotation = new Annotation(Annotation.Type.UNDERLINE, new Dict());
  const storage = new AnnotationStorage/pdf;
  storage.addAnnotation(annotation, page.ref);

  // Initialize editor UI manager
  const commandManager = new CommandManager();
  const editorUI = new AnnotationEditorUIManager({
    commandManager,
    annotationStorage: storage,
    page,
  });

  // Select the annotation
  editorUI.selectAnnotation(annotation);

  // Simulate 'mac+Delete' keydown event
  const event = {
    key: "Delete",
    keyCode: 8,
    metaKey: true, // 'meta' key on macOS
    preventDefault: () => {},
  };

  editorUI.sendKeys(event);

  // Check if annotation was removed
  expect(storage.getAnnotations(page.ref)).toHaveLength(0);
});

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of key combinations that trigger the delete action. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the code is in tools.js, specifically in the AnnotationEditorUIManager class. The keyboard shortcuts are defined in the _keyboardManager, and the patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of triggers for the delete method.

So, the test needs to verify that before the patch, pressing Delete on a Mac didn't trigger the delete action, and after the patch, it does. 

I'll use Jest for the test. I'll create a test case that simulates the scenario. I'll need to mock the necessary classes and methods to isolate the test.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the code uses ES modules, I'll use dynamic imports to load them. I'll import AnnotationEditorUIManager, CommandManager, and KeyboardManager from their respective paths.

Next, I'll set up mocks. I'll mock the KeyboardManager to track whether the delete method is called. I'll create a mock for the commandManager's delete method to check if it's invoked.

In the test, I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditorUIManager with the mocked commandManager and eventBus. I'll set up the keyboardManager with the updated key combinations, including "mac+Delete".

Then, I'll simulate a keydown event with the Delete key and metaKey (since on Mac, the Delete key is often used with the meta modifier). I'll check if the commandManager's delete method is called as a result.

I need to ensure that this test fails before the patch because the "mac+Delete" combination isn't present, so the delete action isn't triggered. After the patch, the test should pass because the combination is added.

I'll structure the test with Jest's async/await syntax, using expect().toHaveBeenCalled() to assert that the delete method was called.

I should also make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external dependencies beyond the provided imports. 

Putting it all together, the test will create the necessary mocks, set up the UI manager, simulate the key press, and verify the outcome. This should effectively test the regression and confirm the patch works as intended.

  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");

  const { KeyboardManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");

  const commandManager = {
    delete: jest.fn(),

  const eventBus = {
    _on: jest.fn(),

  const keyboardManager = new KeyboardManager([
    [
      ["Backspace", "alt+Backspace", "ctrl+Backspace", "shift+Backspace", "mac+Backspace", "mac+alt+Backspace", "mac+ctrl+Backspace", "Delete", "ctrl+Delete", "shift+Delete", "mac+Delete"],
      AnnotationEditorUIManager.prototype.delete,
    ],
  ]);

  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(null, eventBus, null, null);
  uiManager.#commandManager = commandManager;
  uiManager.#keyboardManager = keyboardManager;

  const event = {
    key: "Delete",
    metaKey: true,
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
  };

  uiManager.keydown(event);

  expect(commandManager.delete).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

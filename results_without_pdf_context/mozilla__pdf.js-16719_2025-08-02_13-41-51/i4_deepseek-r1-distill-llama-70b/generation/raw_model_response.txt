Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where pressing the Delete key should delete the selected element when editing a PDF. The patch adds "mac+Delete" to the list of keyboard shortcuts in the AnnotationEditorUIManager class. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch is adding support for the Delete key on macOS. Before the patch, pressing Delete on a Mac might not have triggered the delete action because the shortcut wasn't registered.

So, the test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. I'll simulate the keyboard event for Delete on both Windows and macOS. But since the issue is specifically about macOS, I'll focus on that.

I'll create a test case that initializes the AnnotationEditorUIManager. Then, I'll set up a mock editor and add it to the selected editors. I'll simulate a keyboard event with the Delete key, checking if the delete method is called.

I need to import the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required classes.

In the test, I'll create an instance of AnnotationEditorUIManager, add a mock editor, and then simulate the keydown event. I'll check if the delete method was called using a spy function.

I should ensure that the test doesn't have any dependencies beyond what's provided. I'll use Jest for mocking and testing, but since the example uses async/await, I'll structure the test accordingly.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's self-contained and only tests the specific behavior.

```javascript
it("should delete selected element when Delete key is pressed on macOS", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../shared/util.js");

  class MockEditor {
    constructor() {
      this.id = "test-editor";
      this.isEmpty = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(false);
      this.select = jest.fn();
      this.unselect = jest.fn();
      this.remove = jest.fn();
    }
  }

  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager({
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
  }, {}, {}, {});

  const editor = new MockEditor();
  uiManager.addEditor(editor);
  uiManager.setSelected(editor);

  const deleteSpy = jest.fn();
  uiManager.delete = deleteSpy;

  const event = {
    key: "Delete",
    preventDefault: jest.fn(),
    stopPropagation: jest.fn(),
  };

  uiManager.keydown(event);

  expect(deleteSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

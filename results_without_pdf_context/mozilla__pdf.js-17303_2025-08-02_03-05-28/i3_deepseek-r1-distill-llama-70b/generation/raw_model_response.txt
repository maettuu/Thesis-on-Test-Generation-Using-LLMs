Okay, I need to write a test for the JpegImage.parse function to ensure that it doesn't throw a TypeError when given an incomplete JPEG. The issue was that the code was trying to access frame.samplesPerLine, but frame was undefined because the image data didn't have the necessary markers.

First, I'll look at the existing test file, test/unit/api_spec.js, to see what imports are available. I can reuse imports like assert from '../../src/shared/util.js' and JpegImage from '../../src/core/jpg.js'.

The test should create a minimal JPEG buffer that's missing the EOI marker. I'll construct a buffer that starts with 0xffd8 (SOI) and includes some data but doesn't end properly, causing the parser to fail before the patch.

In the test, I'll wrap the parse call in a try-catch block. Before the patch, this should throw a TypeError. After the patch, it should throw a JpegError instead because of the added check for frame.

I'll structure the test with two cases: one without the patch (expecting a TypeError) and one with the patch (expecting a JpegError). But since the test should run in both scenarios, I'll use async/await and try-catch to handle the exceptions.

I'll import JpegImage and assert dynamically to avoid any issues with the test setup. The test will be self-contained, using only the necessary imports and not relying on any external dependencies beyond what's provided.

Finally, I'll write the test case using it() and ensure it correctly catches the expected errors, verifying that the patch resolves the issue.

```javascript
it("should handle incomplete JPEG without EOI marker", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const { assert } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  // Minimal JPEG data without EOI marker to trigger the issue
  const jpegBuffer = Buffer.from([
    0xff, 0xd8, // SOI
    0xff, 0xe0, // APP0
    0x00, 0x10, // Length

  ].join(','), 'hex');

  try {
    await new JpegImage().parse(jpegBuffer);
    assert(false, "Expected JpegError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    assert(error instanceof JpegError, "Expected JpegError, got " + error.name);
  }
});

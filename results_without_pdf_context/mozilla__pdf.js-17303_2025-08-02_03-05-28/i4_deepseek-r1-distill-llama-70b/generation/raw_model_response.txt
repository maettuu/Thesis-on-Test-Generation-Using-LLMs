Alright, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a TypeError occurs when parsing a JPEG image. The error happens because 'samplesPerLine' is undefined in the frame object. 

First, I'll look at the provided code and the patch. The patch adds a check for the frame object and throws a JpegError if it's not found. This means that before the patch, the code would proceed without a frame, causing the TypeError. After the patch, it should throw a JpegError instead.

I'll create a test that triggers this scenario. The test will use a minimal JPEG input that causes the frame to be undefined. I'll import JpegImage from the correct path and use async/await since the test is in Node.js.

In the test, I'll wrap the parsing in a try-catch block. Before the patch, the code should throw a TypeError. After the patch, it should throw a JpegError with the specific message from the patch.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files. The test data will be a Buffer with the hex 'ffd8', which is the start of an image but not enough to parse correctly, leading to the frame being undefined.

I'll structure the test to expect the correct error type and message after the patch. This way, the test will fail before the patch (since it throws a TypeError) and pass after (since it throws the expected JpegError).

Finally, I'll make sure the test imports JpegImage correctly and handles the asynchronous import properly.

```javascript
it("should throw JpegError when frame data is missing", async () => {
  const { JpegImage } = await import("../../src/core/jpg.js");
  const testData = Buffer.from('ffd8', 'hex');
  
  try {
    await new JpegImage().parse(testData);
    assert.fail("Expected JpegError to be thrown");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof JpegError) {
      assert.equal(error.message, "JpegImage.parse - no frame data found.");
    } else {
      assert.fail("Expected JpegError, got " + error.name);
    }
  }
});
```

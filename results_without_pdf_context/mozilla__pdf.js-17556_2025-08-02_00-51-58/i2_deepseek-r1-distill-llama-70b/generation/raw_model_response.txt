Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the `opMap` in `EvaluatorPreprocessor` was using a regular object with the `Object.prototype`, causing methods like `toString` to be considered valid operators. The patch changes `opMap` to use a null-prototype object, so the test should verify this change.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. Before the patch, `opMap` was a regular object, so when checking for operators, it would incorrectly include inherited properties like `toString`. After the patch, `opMap` uses `Object.create(null)`, so it shouldn't have these inherited properties.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that checks if certain keys exist in `opMap`.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import `EvaluatorPreprocessor` from the correct path. Then, I'll check if `opMap` has properties like `toString`, `__proto__`, and `hasOwnProperty`. If it does, the test should fail because these shouldn't be valid operators.

In the test, I'll use `expect(opMap).toHaveProperty` to check for these properties. Since the patch removes the prototype, these properties should be undefined, making the test pass after the patch.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import `EvaluatorPreprocessor` from the specified path. Also, I'll ensure the test doesn't have any external dependencies beyond what's provided.

Finally, I'll write the test block with `it`, using async/await since the import is dynamic. The test will clearly state that it's checking if `opMap` doesn't include inherited properties, ensuring the patch is effective.

```javascript
it("should not have inherited properties in opMap", async () => {
  const { EvaluatorPreprocessor } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const opMap = EvaluatorPreprocessor.opMap;
  
  // Check for common Object.prototype properties that should not exist
  expect(opMap).not.toHaveProperty("toString");
  expect(opMap).not.toHaveProperty("__proto__");
  expect(opMap).not.toHaveProperty("hasOwnProperty");
});
```

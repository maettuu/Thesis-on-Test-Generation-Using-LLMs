Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where certain JavaScript object default properties like `toString` are considered valid PDF operators. The test should fail before the patch and pass after applying the patch.

First, I'll look at the problem description. The issue is that the `opMap` in `evaluator.js` uses a regular JavaScript object, which inherits properties like `toString` from the prototype. This causes invalid operators to be treated as valid, leading to exceptions later.

The patch changes `opMap` to use `Object.create(null)`, which creates an object without a prototype. This should prevent inherited properties from being considered.

So, the test needs to check if `toString` is considered a valid operator. Before the patch, it should be valid, causing an error when trying to process it. After the patch, it should be ignored.

I'll use the test file `evaluator_spec.js` to write the test. I'll import the necessary modules like `PartialEvaluator`, `Stream`, `OperatorList`, and `XRefMock`.

In the test, I'll create a `PartialEvaluator` instance. Then, I'll create a token stream that includes `toString` as an operator. I'll process this stream using the evaluator and check if it correctly identifies `toString` as an invalid operator.

Before the patch, the evaluator would treat `toString` as a valid operator, leading to an error when trying to access its properties. After the patch, it should be ignored, and no error should occur.

I'll structure the test to create a mock XRef, a stream with the content, and process it. If the processing doesn't throw an error, the test passes, indicating that `toString` is now ignored.

So, the test will generate a stream with `toString` and check that processing it doesn't cause an exception, confirming the patch works.

  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    lexer: new PartialEvaluator.Lexer(content, PartialEvaluator.opMap),
    xref,

  const result = evaluator.read();

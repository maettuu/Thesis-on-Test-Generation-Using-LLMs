Alright, I need to create a test that verifies the patch resolves the issue where PDF objects with default properties like `toString` are incorrectly considered valid operators. 

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The issue arises because the `opMap` in `evaluator.js` uses a regular JavaScript object, which inherits properties like `toString` from its prototype. This causes the code to treat these inherited properties as valid operator tokens, leading to exceptions later on.

The patch changes `opMap` to use `Object.create(null)`, which doesn't inherit any prototype properties. This should prevent `toString` and similar properties from being considered valid operators.

Now, to write a test for this. I'll use the existing test file `test/unit/evaluator_spec.js` and add a new test case. 

I'll need to:
1. Import the necessary modules, like `PartialEvaluator`, `OperatorList`, and `XRefMock`.
2. Set up a mock XRef to simulate the PDF data.
3. Define the `opMap` as it was before the patch, using a regular object.
4. Create a test PDF content that includes the `toString` token.
5. Use `PartialEvaluator` to process the content and check if it correctly identifies `toString` as an invalid operator.

In the test, I'll create a `hello.pdf` content with a stream containing the `toString` token. Then, I'll initialize `PartialEvaluator` with this content and an `OperatorList`. 

I expect that before the patch, the `opMap` would incorrectly treat `toString` as a valid operator, leading to an error when it's not found. After the patch, `toString` should be ignored, and no error should occur.

I'll structure the test to mock the necessary dependencies and assert that the processing doesn't throw an error, indicating that the invalid operator is ignored.

Finally, I'll write the test case using Jest's `it` function, ensuring it's self-contained and only tests the specific behavior.

```javascript
it("should ignore Object.prototype properties in opMap", async () => {
  const xref = new XRefMock({
    hello: new Dict({
      Type: "Pages",
      Kids: [],
      Count: 0,
    }),
  });

  const content = `
    q
    q
    1 0 0 1 0 0 cm
    /hello << 
    /Length 35 0 R
    >> stream
    toString
    endstream
    startxref
    0
    %%EOF
  `;

  const stream = new StringStream(content);
  const operatorList = new OperatorList();
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: {},
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: new Map(),
    builtInCMapCache: new Map(),
    standardFontDataCache: new Map(),
    globalImageCache: new Map(),
    systemFontCache: new Map(),
    options: {},
  });

  const opMap = evaluator.constructor.opMap;
  const originalOpMap = { ...opMap };

  try {
    delete opMap.toString;
    await evaluator.getOperatorList({
      stream,
      task: new WorkerTask(),
      resources: new Dict(),
      operatorList,
      initialState: new EvalState(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    throw new FormatError("Should not have thrown an error");
  }
});
```

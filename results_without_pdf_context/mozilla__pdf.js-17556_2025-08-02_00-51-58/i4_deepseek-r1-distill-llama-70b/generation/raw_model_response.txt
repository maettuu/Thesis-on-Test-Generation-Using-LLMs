Okay, I need to create a test that checks if the issue with the PDF operator 'toString' being incorrectly considered valid is resolved. 

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The issue arises because the opMap object in evaluator.js uses a regular JavaScript object, which inherits properties like 'toString' from Object.prototype. This causes 'toString' to be treated as a valid operator, leading to exceptions later.

The patch changes the opMap to use Object.create(null), preventing the inheritance of these properties. So, after the patch, 'toString' should no longer be recognized as a valid operator.

To test this, I'll create a test case that constructs a PDF with a stream containing the 'toString' token. The test will load this PDF and check if the 'toString' operator is ignored, meaning no error is thrown during parsing.

I'll use the provided example PDF, hello.pdf, which includes the 'toString' token. The test will attempt to get the first page and render it. If the patch is correct, this should not throw an error.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules, like PDFDocument and OperatorList, from their respective paths. Then, I'll set up the test to fetch the example PDF, load the first page, and check for any errors during rendering.

The key part is ensuring that the test fails before the patch and passes after. By using the example PDF, I can simulate the scenario where 'toString' is present and verify that the parser now ignores it.

I'll also make sure the test is self-contained, without any external dependencies beyond what's provided. This way, it can run smoothly in the existing test environment.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's concise and directly addresses the issue without unnecessary complexity.

```javascript
it("should ignore 'toString' as an invalid PDF operator", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { OperatorList } = await import("../../src/core/operator_list.js");

  const pdfPath = "../../src/core/__tests__/files/hello.pdf";
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(
    fetch(pdfPath, { cache: "no-cache" })
  );

  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const operatorList = new OperatorList();

  await page.render({
    canvasContext: null,
    viewport: null,
    flags: 0,
    intent: "default",
    operatorList,
  });

  expect(operatorList.fnArray).not.toContain(OPS.toString);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the £ symbol doesn't display correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, specifically adding a mapping for the £ symbol. 

First, I should understand the problem. The £ symbol, which is U+00A3, was being displayed as U+03AC (ά). The patch adds t[940] = 163; I think this maps the code point to the correct glyph index in the font.

So, the test needs to verify that after the patch, the £ symbol is rendered correctly. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll use Jest for the test. The test will load a PDF containing the £ symbol and check if it's displayed correctly. 

I'll create a PDF file with the £ symbol. Then, I'll use PDF.js to load the PDF and extract the text. I'll check if the extracted text includes the £ symbol correctly.

I need to import the necessary modules: PDFDocument, PDFPage, and TextLayer from pdf.js. Also, I'll need a test PDF file, maybe generated or a sample. Since I can't create files here, I'll assume a test file exists.

In the test, I'll load the PDF, get the first page, render the text layer, and extract the text. Then, I'll check if the text includes '£'. 

If the test passes after the patch, it means the £ symbol is correctly rendered. Before the patch, the extracted text would have 'ά' instead, causing the test to fail.

I should structure the test with async/await for loading the PDF. I'll use Jest's it function and expect assertions.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to import everything correctly and handle any potential errors.

```javascript
it("should correctly display the pound symbol (£) in PDFs", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPage, TextLayer } = await import("../../src/display/annotation_layer.js");
  const { PDFDocument as PDFDocumentCore } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");
  const pdf = await PDFDocumentCore.load("test.pdf");
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const textLayer = new TextLayer({
    page,
    container: document.createElement("div"),
    viewport: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 }),
  });
  const text = await textLayer.getText();
  expect(text).toContain("£");
});
```

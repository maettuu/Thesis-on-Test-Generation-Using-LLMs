Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the £ symbol doesn't display correctly in PDF.js. The user provided a patch that modifies the standard_fonts.js file, specifically adding a mapping for £ (U+00A3) to the correct glyph. 

First, I should understand the problem. The £ symbol was showing as ά (U+03AC) because the glyph mapping was incorrect. The patch adds t[940] = 163; which maps the CID 940 to the correct GID 163, ensuring £ displays properly.

Now, to write the test. I'll use the test file provided, test/unit/api_spec.js. I need to import the necessary modules. The test should open a PDF containing the £ symbol and check if it's rendered correctly.

I'll use the TestPdfsServer to get the test PDF. The PDF is named "PoundSymbol.pdf" and is located in TEST_PDFS_PATH. I'll set up a before hook to start the server and after to stop it.

In the test, I'll create a PDFDocumentProxy using getDocument to load the PDF. Then, I'll get the first page and its text content. I'll extract the text and check if it includes the £ symbol.

Wait, how does the text extraction work? The text might be encoded, so I need to ensure that the £ is correctly extracted. Alternatively, maybe I should check the glyph mapping directly, but that might be more complex. Text extraction is more straightforward for a regression test.

I'll write the test using Jest's it function. I'll use async/await for the operations. I'll import the required modules, set up the server, load the PDF, get the page, extract the text, and assert that the £ is present.

I should also handle any potential errors, maybe with try-catch, but the test should fail if any step throws an error.

So, the test structure would be:

- Import necessary modules.
- Use beforeAll to start the server.
- Use afterAll to stop it.
- In the test, get the document, load the page, extract text, and assert.

Wait, but the example structure given by the user uses a single it block without hooks. So maybe I should structure it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the test can be self-contained within the it block.

Alternatively, I can create a new test file, but the user wants to add the test to the existing test/unit/api_spec.js. So I'll add the it block there.

I'll need to import TestPdfsServer and get the PDF path. Then, in the test, I'll start the server, get the PDF, load the page, extract the text, and check for the £.

I should make sure that the test only runs in Node.js, as the TestPdfsServer is Node-specific. So I'll check if isNodeJS is true before running the test.

Putting it all together, the test will:

1. Start the TestPdfsServer before the test.
2. Use getDocument to load the PDF.
3. Get the first page and its text content.
4. Check if the text includes the £ symbol.
5. Stop the server after the test.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, ensuring all imports are correctly referenced and the test is self-contained.

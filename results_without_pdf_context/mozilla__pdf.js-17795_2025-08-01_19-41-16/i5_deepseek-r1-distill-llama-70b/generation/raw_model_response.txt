Alright, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some inlined images aren't rendering correctly because they lack the closing 'EI' marker. The patch adds error handling around the image decoding process, so the test should check if the images are rendered correctly after the patch.

First, I'll use the provided PDF file, image1.pdf, which triggers the bug. I'll set up a test using Jest and the PDF.js testing utilities. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument, PDFPage, and TestReporter.

I'll create a test function that opens the PDF, navigates to the second page (since the issue might be on that page), and checks if the expected number of images is rendered. Before the patch, this should fail because only one image is rendered. After the patch, all images should render correctly.

I'll use the PDFPageProxy to get the page and then count the number of images using operatorList.getImages().length. I'll set an expectation that this length should be 2, as the test PDF likely has two images.

Finally, I'll structure the test using async/await to handle the asynchronous operations properly. The test will fail before the patch and pass after, ensuring the regression is fixed.

```javascript
it("should render all inline images correctly", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { PDFPageProxy } = await import("../../src/display/pdf_page.js");
  const { TestReporter } = await import("./testreporter.js");

  const reporter = new TestReporter();
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(
    fetch("image1.pdf"),
    { 
      onProgress: (progress) => reporter.onProgress(progress),
      password: null,
      cMapLoader: null,
      fontLoader: null
    }
  );

  const page = await pdf.getPage(2);
  const pageProxy = new PDFPageProxy(page);
  
  await pageProxy.run();
  const operatorList = pageProxy.getOperatorList();
  const expectedImageCount = 2;

  expect(operatorList.getImages().length).toBe(expectedImageCount);
});
```

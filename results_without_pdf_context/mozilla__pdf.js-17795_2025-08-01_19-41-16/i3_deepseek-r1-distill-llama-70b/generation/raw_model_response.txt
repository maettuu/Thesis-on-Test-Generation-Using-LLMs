Okay, I need to create a test for the regression issue where some inlined images aren't rendering correctly because they're missing the closing 'EI' operator. The patch adds a try-catch block around the image processing code to handle cases where images can't be decoded, preventing the entire rendering from failing.

First, I'll look at the existing test file to see what's available. It imports necessary modules like PartialEvaluator, OperatorList, and XRefMock. I can use these to set up a mock environment.

I'll create a test case where an inlined image is added without the 'EI' operator. The test should check if the evaluator correctly handles this by logging a warning but not throwing an error. 

I'll set up a mock XRef to simulate the PDF data. Then, I'll create a PartialEvaluator instance and process the content. I'll use Jest's fake timers to wait for asynchronous operations to complete.

In the test, I'll add an inlined image without the 'EI' operator. The evaluator should catch this as an error, log a warning, and continue processing without crashing. I'll check the console output to ensure the warning is logged and that no error is thrown.

By doing this, the test will verify that the patch correctly handles the missing 'EI' case, thus fixing the issue where only one image was rendered.

```javascript
it("should handle inlined images without EI", async () => {
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const idFactory = createIdFactory();
  const handler = {
    send: jest.fn(),
    sendWithPromise: jest.fn(),
  };
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler,
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory,
    options: {
      ignoreErrors: false,
    },
  });

  const dict = new Dict();
  const image = new Stream(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));
  const operatorList = new OperatorList();

  // Mock the image processing to throw an error
  const originalCreateImageData = PartialEvaluator.prototype.createImageData;
  PartialEvaluator.prototype.createImageData = async () => {
    throw new Error("Failed to decode image");
  };

  const consoleSpy = jest.spyOn(console, "warn").mockImplementation(() => {});

  // Add an inlined image without EI
  await evaluator.buildPaintImageXObject({
    resources: dict,
    image,
    isInline: true,
    operatorList,
    cacheKey: null,
    localImageCache: null,
    localColorSpaceCache: null,
  });

  // Verify that the warning was logged
  expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Unable to decode inline image: \"Failed to decode image\".");

  // Restore the original method
  PartialEvaluator.prototype.createImageData = originalCreateImageData;
});
```

Okay, I need to write a test that checks if the patch fixes the issue where only one image is rendered in the provided PDF. The issue is that the PDF has inlined images without the closing 'EI' which caused the rendering problem.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The patch adds a try-catch block around the image processing code. This means that if decoding an image fails, it will log a warning but continue processing other images instead of stopping.

So, the test should verify that all images are rendered correctly after the patch. Before the patch, the test would fail because only one image is rendered. After the patch, all images should be rendered.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll create a PDF document from the provided file, render the first page, and check if all images are loaded.

I'll import the necessary modules like 'pdfjs-lib' for creating the PDF document and 'jsdom' for handling SVG data. Then, I'll set up the PDF and render the page. After rendering, I'll parse the SVG output to count the number of images rendered.

The test will fail before the patch because only one image is rendered. After applying the patch, the test should pass as all images are correctly processed.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained, so I'll include all necessary imports and setup within the test block. I'll also make sure the test is concise and only checks the specific behavior.

Finally, I'll write the test using async/await to handle the promises from PDF.js and JSDOM. The test will compare the expected number of images with the actual count from the rendered SVG.

```javascript
it("should render all images in PDF with inlined images without closing EI", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../web/pdf_document.js");
  const { JSDOM } = await import("jsdom");
  const pdfBytes = await fetch("image1.pdf").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
  const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfBytes, { cMapUrl: "/web/cmaps/" });
  const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1 });
  const renderOptions = {
    canvasContext: new (await import("canvas")).Canvas(),
    viewport,
    enableWebGL: false,
  };
  const result = await page.render(renderOptions);
  const svg = await result.getSvg();
  const dom = new JSDOM(svg);
  const images = dom.window.document.querySelectorAll("image");
  expect(images.length).toBe(2);
});
```

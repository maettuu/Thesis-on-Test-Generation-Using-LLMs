Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where some inlined images aren't rendering correctly. The problem was caused by missing the closing `EI` in the PDF, which made the parser mishandle the images. The patch adds a try-catch block around the image processing code to handle such cases more gracefully.

First, I'll look at the existing test file to see what's available. It imports necessary modules like PartialEvaluator, OperatorList, and some primitives. I can reuse these imports.

I need to simulate an inline image without the `EI` marker. So, I'll create a mock stream that represents such a PDF structure. The content should include an inline image that's not properly closed.

I'll set up the test by creating a new PartialEvaluator instance with the appropriate options, especially setting `ignoreErrors` to false so that any errors during processing are thrown. Then, I'll create an OperatorList to capture the operations.

Next, I'll define the inline image data. It should be a minimal PDF structure with an inline image that's missing the `EI` marker. This will trigger the error condition.

When processing this image with the old code, it should throw an error because it can't handle the missing `EI`. But with the patch, the try-catch should catch the error, log a warning, and continue without throwing an exception.

In the test, I'll call `buildPaintImageXObject` and check if it throws an error. If the code is patched correctly, the function should handle the error and not throw, meaning the test should not throw an exception.

I'll structure the test using async/await and use `expect` to check that no error is thrown. This way, the test will fail before the patch (since an error is thrown) and pass after (since the error is caught and handled).

I also need to ensure that the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import any necessary modules within the test function to maintain compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's concise and directly tests the scenario addressed by the patch.

```javascript
it("should handle inline images without closing EI", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator, OperatorList, Dict, Name, Stream } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const { StringStream } = await import("../../src/core/stream.js");
  
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const options = {
    ignoreErrors: false,
    isOffscreenCanvasSupported: false,
  };
  
  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: null,
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: createIdFactory(),
    fontCache: null,
    builtInCMapCache: null,
    standardFontDataCache: null,
    globalImageCache: null,
    systemFontCache: null,
    options,
  });
  
  const operatorList = new OperatorList();
  const resources = new Dict();
  const imageStream = new StringStream("q 0 0 10 10 rect f*");
  
  await expect(
    evaluator.buildPaintImageXObject({
      resources,
      image: imageStream,
      isInline: true,
      operatorList,
      cacheKey: null,
      localImageCache: null,
      localColorSpaceCache: null,
    })
  ).resolves.not.toThrow();
});

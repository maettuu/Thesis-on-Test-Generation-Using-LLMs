Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where radio buttons in print view don't reflect their real state on the PDF form. The patch provided modifies the `annotation.js` file, specifically the `_processRadioButton` method. 

First, I'll look at the patch. It changes `this.data.fieldValue = this.data.buttonValue = null;` to `this.data.buttonValue = null;`. So, the `fieldValue` is no longer being set to null. This suggests that `fieldValue` was being incorrectly reset, causing the radio buttons' state not to show up correctly in print view.

To test this, I need to create a scenario where a radio button's state is set and then check if the print view reflects that state. 

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since I'm using Node.js, I'll dynamically import `annotation.js` and `test_utils.js`. 

Next, I'll create a sample PDF with a radio button field. I'll use `PDFDocument` from `annotation.js` to create a new document and add a page. Then, I'll create a radio button field with a name like "radiobutton1" and set its value to "A". 

I'll then create an annotation for this field. The annotation should correctly reflect the selected state. 

The key part is to generate the print view and check if the radio button's state is correctly displayed. I'll render the page and extract the text to see if the selected value is present.

Before the patch, the `fieldValue` was set to null, which might have caused the print view not to display the selected state. After the patch, `fieldValue` should retain its value, so the print view should show the correct state.

I'll write an `it` block that sets up the PDF, creates the radio button, and checks the print view's text. If the patch works, the test should pass after applying it but fail before.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, uses only the provided imports, and doesn't introduce new dependencies. I'll structure the test to initialize variables, set up the PDF, generate the print view, and compare the expected value with the actual output.

Finally, I'll return only the JavaScript code as required, ensuring it's concise and to the point.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { ButtonWidgetAnnotation, PDFDocument, Page } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { buildGetDocumentParams } = await import("./test_utils.js");

  // Create a PDF with a radio button field
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();
  const field = pdf.createRadioButton({
    name: "radiobutton1",
    value: "A",
  });

  // Create the annotation
  const annotation = new ButtonWidgetAnnotation({
    field: field,
    page: page,
  });

  // Generate the print view content
  const printView = await annotation.getPrintView();

  // The expected state should include the selected value
  const expectedValue = "A";
  const actualValue = printView.textContent;

  expect(actualValue).toContain(expectedValue);
});
```

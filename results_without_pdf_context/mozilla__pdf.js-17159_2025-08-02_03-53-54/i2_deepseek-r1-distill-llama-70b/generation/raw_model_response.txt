Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where radio buttons in print view don't reflect their real state on the PDF form. The patch provided modifies the `_processRadioButton` method in `annotation.js`. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. Before the patch, the code set both `this.data.fieldValue` and `this.data.buttonValue` to null. The patch removes `this.data.fieldValue = null`, so only `buttonValue` is set. This change likely ensures that the radio button's state is correctly read from the parent field's `V` entry.

To test this, I need a PDF that has radio buttons with a parent field. The test should check if the radio button's state is correctly reflected. 

I'll create a test PDF where the radio button's parent field has a value. I'll use `pdf-lib` to generate this PDF. Then, I'll write a test that opens this PDF, gets the annotation, and checks if the `buttonValue` is correctly set.

In the test, I'll import `PDFDocument` and `PDFPage` from `api.js`. I'll also import `Annotation` from `annotation.js` to create the annotation. I'll generate a PDF with a radio button where the parent's `V` entry is set to a name object, say "Radio1".

In the test function, I'll load the PDF, get the first page, and the annotations. I'll create a `ButtonWidgetAnnotation` instance with the appropriate parameters. Then, I'll check if `data.buttonValue` equals "Radio1". If it does, the test passes.

I need to ensure that this test fails before the patch because, without the fix, `fieldValue` might not be correctly set from the parent's `V` entry. After the patch, `buttonValue` should correctly reflect the state.

I should structure the test as an `it` block, using async/await for asynchronous operations. I'll make sure to handle any potential errors and clean up the PDF document after the test.

So, putting it all together, the test will generate a specific PDF, load it, and verify the radio button's state is correctly read after the patch.

```javascript
it("should correctly reflect radio button state in print view", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { Annotation } = await import("../../src/core/annotation.js");
  const { Name } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");

  // Create a sample PDF with radio buttons
  const pdf = new PDFDocument();
  const page = pdf.addPage();
  const annotation = new ButtonWidgetAnnotation({
    dict: {
      get: (key) => {
        if (key === "Parent") {
          const parentDict = new Dict();
          parentDict.set("V", new Name("Radio1"));
          return parentDict;
        }
        return null;
      }
    },
    page,
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    width: 10,
    height: 10,
  });

  // Process the radio button annotation
  await annotation._processRadioButton({
    dict: annotation.dict,
    page,
  });

  // Verify the button value is correctly set from the parent field's V entry
  expect(annotation.data.buttonValue).toBe("Radio1");

  await pdf.close();
});

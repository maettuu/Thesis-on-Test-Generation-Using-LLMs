Okay, I need to create a test for the regression issue where the PolygonAnnotation fill isn't rendered in PDF.js but works in Acrobat and Edge. The patch provided modifies the annotation.js file, so I should write a test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It imports several modules, including Annotation, MarkupAnnotation, and others. I can reuse these imports.

The test should create a PDF with a polygon annotation that has both fill and stroke. Then, it should check if the fill is rendered correctly.

I'll set up a mock XRef using XRefMock. Then, I'll create a sample annotation dictionary with the necessary properties, including the fill color and stroke color.

I'll create an instance of PolygonAnnotation using AnnotationFactory.create. Then, I'll call getOperatorList to render the annotation.

After rendering, I'll check the generated operator list for the 'f' command, which indicates a fill. The presence of this command means the fill was rendered.

Before the patch, the test should fail because the fill isn't rendered. After the patch, it should pass because the fill is correctly included.

I'll structure the test using async/await and Jest's it function. I'll import the necessary modules and set up the mock data. Then, I'll perform the checks and expect the 'f' operator to be present.

I need to ensure the test is self-contained and only tests the specific regression. I'll use the provided imports and avoid adding new dependencies.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's concise and directly addresses the issue.

```javascript
it("should render filled polygon annotations correctly", async () => {
  const xref = new XRefMock();
  const pdfManager = {
    ensureCatalog: async () => ({}),
    getPage: async () => ({}),
    ensureDoc: async () => ({ numPages: 1 }),
  };

  const annotationDict = new Dict();
  annotationDict.set("Subtype", new Name("Polygon"));
  annotationDict.set("Rect", [0, 0, 100, 100]);
  annotationDict.set("Vertices", new Float32Array([0, 0, 100, 0, 100, 100, 0, 100]));
  annotationDict.set("IC", new Name("yellow"));
  annotationDict.set("C", new Name("black"));
  annotationDict.set("CA", 1);

  const params = {
    xref,
    ref: new Ref(1),
    annotationGlobals: {
      pdfManager,
      acroForm: new Dict(),
      structTreeRoot: new Dict(),
      baseUrl: new Dict(),
      attachments: new Dict(),
      globalColorSpaceCache: new Dict(),
    },
    evaluatorOptions: {},
  };

  const annotation = await AnnotationFactory.create(params);

  const operatorList = await annotation.getOperatorList(
    new PartialEvaluator(),
    new WorkerTask(),
    RenderingIntentFlag.DISPLAY,
    null,
    null
  );

  const expectedFillOperator = "f";
  const actualOperators = operatorList.opList.ops
    .map(op => op.cmd)
    .join("");

  expect(actualOperators).toContain(expectedFillOperator);
});
```

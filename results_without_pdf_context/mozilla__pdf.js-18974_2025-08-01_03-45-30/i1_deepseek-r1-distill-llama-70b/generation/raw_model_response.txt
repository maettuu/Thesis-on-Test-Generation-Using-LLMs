Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The patch provided modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor to filter out non-BaseStream instances, which probably caused the issue because some streams weren't being handled correctly.

First, I'll look at the test file. It's test/unit/stream_spec.js. It imports Dict, PredictorStream, and Stream. I can use these imports as they are.

The test should check if StreamsSequenceStream correctly includes only BaseStream instances. So, I'll create a test case where I pass a mix of BaseStream and other streams. The constructor should filter out the non-BaseStream ones.

I'll create an instance of StreamsSequenceStream with some example streams. Maybe use NullStream as a BaseStream and others like PredictorStream or regular Streams. Then, I'll check if the streams array in the instance only contains the valid ones.

In the test, I'll create two NullStreams and two other streams. Then, pass them to the constructor. After that, I'll assert that the streams array in the instance has only the two NullStreams.

I should also make sure the test is async and properly uses await since some imports might be dynamic. But in this case, since I'm using relative imports, it should be fine.

So, the test will look like this: create the streams, instantiate StreamsSequenceStream, and check the filtered streams.

```javascript
it("should correctly filter streams in StreamsSequenceStream", async () => {
  const { NullStream, BaseStream } = await import("../../src/core/decode_stream.js");
  const streams = [
    new NullStream(),
    new NullStream(),
    new (class extends Stream {})(),
    new (class extends PredictorStream {})(),
  ];
  const streamsSequence = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);
  expect(streamsSequence.streams).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(streamsSequence.streams.every(stream => stream instanceof BaseStream)).toBe(true);
});
```

[2025-08-01 03:53:45] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should skip nonStream substreams in StreamsSequenceStream", async () => {
  const { StreamsSequenceStream } = await import("../../src/core/decode_stream.js");
  const { BaseStream } = await import("../../src/core/base_stream.js");
  const { Stream } = await import("../../src/core/stream.js");

  const validStream = new Stream(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
  const invalidStream = {}; // Not an instance of BaseStream
  const streams = [validStream, invalidStream];

  const sequenceStream = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);
  const expectedLength = validStream.length;
  const actualLength = sequenceStream._rawMinBufferLength;

  expect(actualLength).toBe(expectedLength);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/stream_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor in decode_stream.js. My task is to create a test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I should understand the problem. The issue is that when loading a specific PDF, page 45 doesn't display correctly. The patch adds a line to filter streams, ensuring only BaseStream instances are included. This suggests that non-BaseStream streams were causing issues.

I need to simulate this scenario in the test. I'll create a test that constructs a StreamsSequenceStream with a mix of valid and invalid streams. The invalid streams might cause issues before the patch.

I'll import the necessary modules: DecodeStream and StreamsSequenceStream from decode_stream.js. Then, I'll set up a test where I create a StreamsSequenceStream with a valid stream and a non-BaseStream object, like a StringStream.

Before the patch, the constructor doesn't filter streams, so including a non-BaseStream would cause errors during readBlock. The test should expect an error when reading the streams. After the patch, the non-BaseStream is filtered out, so the read should succeed without errors.

In the test, I'll create a StreamsSequenceStream, attempt to read it, and check if an error is thrown. Before the patch, it should throw; after, it shouldn't. But since the test is written to pass after the patch, I'll structure it to expect no error.

I'll also need to mock or create a sample stream for testing. Using a StringStream with some data seems appropriate. I'll set up the test to read the stream and ensure it doesn't throw an error, indicating the invalid stream was properly filtered.

Finally, I'll write the test using Jest syntax, ensuring it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports. The test will import the necessary modules, set up the streams, and assert that no error occurs when reading.

```javascript
it("should properly handle streams sequence with invalid streams", async () => {
  const { DecodeStream, StreamsSequenceStream } = await import("../../src/core/decode_stream.js");
  const { Stream } = await import("../../src/core/stream.js");

  // Create a test stream
  const stringStream = new Stream(new Uint8Array([0x41, 0x42, 0x43]));

  // Create a StreamsSequenceStream with a mix of valid and invalid streams
  const streams = [stringStream, {}]; // {} is an invalid stream
  const streamSequence = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);

  // Attempt to read the stream
  let errorOccurred = false;
  try {
    await streamSequence.readBlock();
  } catch (e) {
    errorOccurred = true;
  }

  // After the patch, the invalid stream should be filtered out and no error should occur
  expect(errorOccurred).toBe(false);
});
```

Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor to filter out non-BaseStream instances. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like the patch adds a line to filter the streams, ensuring only BaseStream instances are included. This probably prevents errors when non-stream objects are processed.

The test needs to fail before the patch and pass after. So, I'll create a test that loads the problematic PDF and checks if page 45 renders correctly. 

I'll use the PDFDocumentLoadingTask to load the PDF and navigate to page 45. Then, I'll render it and check for any rendering errors. If the test doesn't throw an error, it means the page rendered correctly.

I should import the necessary modules like PDFDocument, PDFPage, and PDFViewer. Since the test is self-contained, I'll use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions during loading or rendering. If an exception occurs, the test will fail, indicating the issue isn't resolved.

I need to ensure the test is concise and only tests the specific behavior. So, I'll structure it with async/await for clarity and use the provided imports without adding new dependencies.

Finally, I'll write the test block, making sure it's named appropriately and covers the expected behavior after the patch.

```javascript
it("should render page 45 of a PDF with invalid streams in StreamsSequenceStream", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPage } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { PDFViewer } = await import("../../src/web/pdf_viewer.js");

  const pdf = await PDFDocument.create('src/core/decode_stream.js');
  const page = await pdf.getPage(45);
  const viewer = new PDFViewer();
  viewer.setPage(page);

  try {
    await page.render({
      canvasContext: viewer.canvasContext,
      viewport: page.getViewport({ scale: 1 }),
    });
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  } catch (e) {
    throw new Error("Failed to render page 45");
  }
});
```

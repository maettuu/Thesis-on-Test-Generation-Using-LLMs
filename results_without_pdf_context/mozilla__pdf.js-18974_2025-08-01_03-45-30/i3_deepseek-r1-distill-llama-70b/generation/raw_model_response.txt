Okay, I need to write a regression test for the given patch in PDF.js. Let me start by understanding the problem and the patch.

The issue is that the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a PDF file and steps to reproduce the problem. The patch modifies the StreamsSequenceStream constructor in decode_stream.js. The patch filters out streams that aren't instances of BaseStream, which probably prevents invalid streams from causing issues.

Looking at the test file, test/unit/stream_spec.js, it currently imports Dict, PredictorStream, and Stream. My test will need to use these or others as necessary.

The test should check if the StreamsSequenceStream correctly handles a list of streams, especially after the patch. The patch adds a filter to remove non-BaseStream instances. So, the test should create a StreamsSequenceStream with a mix of valid and invalid streams, then check if only the valid ones are processed.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Import the necessary modules, including StreamsSequenceStream and BaseStream.
2. Create a test stream that returns a specific chunk of data.
3. Create a StreamsSequenceStream with some valid and invalid streams.
4. Read the data from the stream and check if it matches the expected result.

I need to ensure that the test fails before the patch and passes after. So, the test should assert that the correct data is read after filtering.

I'll write the test using async functions since stream operations are asynchronous. The test will read the data from the StreamsSequenceStream and compare it to the expected buffer.

Now, I'll draft the code, making sure to use the correct imports and structure.

```javascript
it("should handle streams sequence with filtering", async () => {
  const { StreamsSequenceStream, BaseStream } = await import("../../src/core/decode_stream.js");
  const testStream = new Stream(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]));
  
  // Create a mix of valid and invalid streams
  const streams = [
    testStream,
    new Stream(new Uint8Array([5, 6, 7, 8])), // valid
    {}, // invalid, not a BaseStream
    new BaseStream() // valid
  ];

  const streamSequence = new StreamsSequenceStream(streams);
  const result = await streamSequence.getBytes();
  
  // Expected data from the valid streams (testStream and the second Stream)
  const expected = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
  expect(result).toEqual(expected);
});
```

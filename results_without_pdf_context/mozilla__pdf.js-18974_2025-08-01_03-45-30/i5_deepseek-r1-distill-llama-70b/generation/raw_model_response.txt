Okay, I need to write a regression test for the bug where the signature page of a digitally signed PDF doesn't render correctly. The user provided a patch that modifies the DecodeStream.js file. My test should fail before the patch and pass after applying it.

First, I'll start by understanding the issue. The problem occurs when loading a specific PDF and navigating to page 45. The expected behavior is that the page displays correctly, but instead, an error is shown. The patch filters out streams that aren't instances of BaseStream, which might be causing the issue.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll need to import the necessary modules, like PDFDocument and FetchStream. The test will load the provided PDF, navigate to page 45, and check if it renders without errors.

I'll set up an async function in the test block. Inside, I'll use fetch to get the PDF file. Then, I'll create a new PDFDocument instance using FetchStream to handle the data. Once the document is loaded, I'll fetch the 45th page (index 44 since pages are zero-based) and try to render it.

I'll wrap the page rendering in a try-catch block. If an error occurs, it means the test fails. If it renders successfully, the test passes. 

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. I'll dynamically import the required modules to ensure compatibility with Node.js.

So, the test will look something like this: load the PDF, go to page 45, and check for any errors during rendering. If no error is thrown, the test passes, indicating the patch fixed the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly render signature page of digitally signed PDF", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { FetchStream } = await import("../../src/display/fetch_stream.js");

  const pdfData = await fetch("https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17550758/doc1520828609.pdf");
  const stream = new FetchStream(pdfData.body);
  const pdf = new PDFDocument(null, stream);

  const page = await pdf.getPage(45);
  const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1.0 });

  try {
    await page.render({
      viewport,
      canvasContext: null,
      continueRendering: () => true,
    });
    expect().nothing();
  } catch (error) {
    fail("Error rendering page: " + error.message);
  }
});
```

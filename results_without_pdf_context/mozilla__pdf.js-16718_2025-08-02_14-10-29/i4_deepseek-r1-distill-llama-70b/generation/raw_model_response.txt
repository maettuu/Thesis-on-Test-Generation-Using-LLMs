Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where PDF annotations aren't saved on certain PDFs. The patch provided makes some changes to the code, so I should focus on testing the scenario where annotations are saved correctly after the patch.

First, I'll look at the patch details. The main changes are in worker.js, writer.js, and xref.js. In worker.js, they added a reference to 'linearization' and modified how startXRef is determined. In writer.js, they updated a condition to include 'hasXfaDatasetsEntry'. In xref.js, they introduced a new variable to track the first XRef stream position.

The test should check if annotations are saved properly. I'll use a sample PDF that had the issue before the patch. I'll load the PDF, add an annotation, save it, and then check if the annotation exists in the saved PDF.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument and PDFViewer. I'll load the PDF, ensure it's loaded, create a viewer, add an annotation, save the document, and then load the saved data back to check for the annotation.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files, so I'll use a base64 encoded PDF. I'll create a new PDFDocument, add a text annotation, save it, and then re-open it to verify the annotation exists.

I'll set up the test to fail if any step doesn't meet the expectations, ensuring it correctly validates the patch's effectiveness.

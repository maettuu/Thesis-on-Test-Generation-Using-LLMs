Alright, I need to write a regression test for the issue where redoing an image/text/drawing in a PDF doesn't work with keyboard shortcuts. The patch provided modifies the key combinations in tools.js to include more cases, especially for Mac where the key might be uppercase.

First, I'll plan the test structure. The test should check if redo works correctly using the new keyboard shortcuts. I'll use the CommandManager to simulate key presses.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules: AnnotationEditorUIManager and CommandManager from their respective paths. Then, I'll set up a test PDF document and a PDFPageProxy to get the first page.

Next, I'll create an AnnotationEditorUIManager instance and set up the command manager with a handler for the 'redo' command. This handler will track when redo is called.

I'll add an annotation, like a square, to the page. Then, I'll undo that action using the undo command. After undoing, I'll simulate pressing the redo keyboard shortcut. Since the patch includes both 'ctrl+shift+z' and 'ctrl+shift+Z' (and their Mac equivalents), I'll choose one to test, maybe 'ctrl+shift+Z' for coverage.

When the redo shortcut is pressed, the command handler should trigger the redo function. I'll use a promise to wait for this to happen and ensure that the annotation is indeed redone.

Finally, I'll compare the expected result (redo called) with the actual outcome to assert the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, uses only the provided imports, and runs asynchronously. I'll structure the test with clear setup, execution, and assertion steps to verify the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should redo annotations using keyboard shortcuts", async () => {
  const { AnnotationEditorUIManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { CommandManager } = await import("../../src/display/editor/tools.js");
  const { PDFDocument, PDFPageProxy } = await import("../../src/core/document.js");

  // Initialize test document and page
  const pdfDocument = await PDFDocument.load(
    await import("../../src/web/test_utils.js").then(utils => utils.buildGetDocumentParams("simple.pdf"))
  );
  const page = await pdfDocument.getPage(1);

  // Setup annotation editor and command manager
  const annotationEditor = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(page);
  const commandManager = new CommandManager(annotationEditor);
  const redoCalled = { value: false };

  // Mock the redo command handler
  commandManager.on("redo", () => {
    redoCalled.value = true;
  });

  // Add an annotation and undo it
  const annotation = await annotationEditor.addAnnotation({
    type: "square",
    rectangle: [0, 0, 100, 100],
  });
  await annotationEditor.undo();

  // Test the redo keyboard shortcut
  await commandManager.execute({
    type: "keydown",
    key: "z",
    ctrlKey: true,
    shiftKey: true,
  });

  // Verify redo was called
  expect(redoCalled.value).toBe(true);
});

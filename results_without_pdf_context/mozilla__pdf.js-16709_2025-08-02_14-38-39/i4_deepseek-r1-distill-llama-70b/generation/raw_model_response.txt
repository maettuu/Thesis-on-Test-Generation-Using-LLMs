Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where the redo shortcut doesn't work for images, text, or drawings in the PDF editor. The user provided a patch that modifies the keyboard shortcuts in tools.js. 

First, I should understand the problem. Before the patch, the redo shortcut (Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z on Windows, and similar on Mac) didn't work correctly. The patch updates the keyboard shortcuts to include more variations, especially handling cases where the event key might be uppercase, like 'Z' instead of 'z' on Mac.

So, the test needs to simulate adding an annotation, undoing it, and then trying to redo it using the affected shortcuts. The test should fail before the patch because the redo doesn't work, and pass after the patch.

I'll use the test framework to set up a PDF document with a page. Then, I'll create an AnnotationEditorUIManager instance. I'll add an editor, perhaps a text annotation, and then trigger an undo and redo using the keyboard events.

I need to import the necessary modules. Since the test is in Node.js, I'll use dynamic imports for the required files. I'll also mock the PDF document and page to avoid actual file dependencies.

In the test, I'll simulate adding an annotation, then trigger an undo, and then test if the redo brings it back. I'll check if the editor is present after redo.

I should structure the test with async/await for each step, ensuring that each event is properly dispatched. I'll use Jest's expect to assert that the editor count changes correctly after each action.

I also need to handle any potential issues, like the annotation not being added or removed as expected. By checking the number of editors before and after each operation, I can verify if the undo and redo work as intended.

Finally, I'll make sure the test is self-contained, using only the provided imports and not introducing any new dependencies. This way, the test will accurately reflect the bug and the fix provided by the patch.

  const eventBus = { _on: jest.fn(), _off: jest.fn(), dispatch: jest.fn() };

  const uiManager = new AnnotationEditorUIManager(container, eventBus, pdfDocument, {});
  const layer = new AnnotationEditorLayer(page, pdfDocument, null, null, null, null, null, null);
  uiManager.addLayer(layer);

  // Add an editor
  const editor = layer.createEditor("text");
  uiManager.addEditor(editor);
  expect(uiManager.#allEditors.size).toBe(1);

  // Undo
  const undoEvent = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    keyCode: 90,
    key: "z",
    ctrlKey: true,
  });
  container.dispatchEvent(undoEvent);
  expect(uiManager.#commandManager.hasSomethingToUndo()).toBe(false);
  expect(uiManager.#allEditors.size).toBe(0);

  // Redo
  const redoEvent = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    keyCode: 89,
    key: "y",
    ctrlKey: true,
  });
  container.dispatchEvent(redoEvent);

  // Verify the editor was restored
  expect(uiManager.#allEditors.size).toBe(1);

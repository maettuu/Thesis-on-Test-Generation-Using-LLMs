Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where a certain PDF file stopped rendering in Firefox 115.0.2 but worked in 109.0.1. The problem was fixed by a patch in xref.js, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file, test/unit/api_spec.js. It imports several modules, including getDocument from display/api.js. I can use that to load the PDF.

The test should attempt to load the problematic PDF and check if it's parsed correctly. If it throws an InvalidPDFException, the test fails. So, I'll wrap the getDocument call in a try-catch block.

I need to use the specific PDF file from the issue. The URL is given as https://lab6.com/1, but since it's a test, I should probably use a local copy. However, the test_utils.js has a TEST_PDFS_PATH, so I can construct the URL using that.

The test will be an async function. I'll use await to wait for getDocument to complete. If it succeeds, the test passes; if it throws, it fails.

I should structure the test with try-catch inside the async function. If an InvalidPDFException is caught, the test fails. Otherwise, it passes.

I'll name the test "should handle edge case PDF with non-traditional structure" to describe the issue.

Now, putting it all together, the test imports the necessary modules, constructs the URL, and tries to get the document. If it doesn't throw, the test passes.

I should make sure the test is self-contained and only uses the provided imports. No new dependencies are needed.

So, the code will import getDocument and TEST_PDFS_PATH, construct the URL, and test loading the PDF.

```javascript
it("should handle edge case PDF with non-traditional structure", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { TEST_PDFS_PATH } = await import("./test_utils.js");
  
  const pdfUrl = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/issue16759.pdf`;
  let pdfDoc;
  
  try {
    pdfDoc = await getDocument({
      url: pdfUrl,
      pdfWorker: new PDFWorker(),
      pdfDocumentLoader: new PDFDocumentLoadingTask({
        url: pdfUrl,
        transporter: new PDFDataRangeTransport(),
      }),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("PDF failed to parse with InvalidPDFException");
    }
    throw error;
  }
  
  if (!pdfDoc) {
    throw new Error("Failed to load PDF document");
  }
});
```

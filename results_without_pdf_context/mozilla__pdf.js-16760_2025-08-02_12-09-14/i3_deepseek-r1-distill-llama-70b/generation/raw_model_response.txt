Okay, I need to create a regression test for the issue where a specific PDF file stops rendering in Firefox 115.0.2 but worked in 109.0.1. The user provided a patch that modifies the XRef class, so my test should check if this patch fixes the problem.

First, I'll look at the existing test file to see what's available. The test file has imports from various modules, including getDocument from display/api.js, which is useful for loading the PDF. I'll need to import the necessary modules without adding new dependencies.

The test should load the problematic PDF and check if it renders correctly. If the PDF is invalid, the test should catch that. So, I'll set up a test that attempts to get the document and the first page. If it throws an exception, the test fails.

I'll structure the test using async/await since getDocument is asynchronous. I'll wrap the logic in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions during loading.

Before the patch, the PDF should throw an InvalidPDFException, so the test should expect that and fail. After the patch, the PDF should load without errors, so the test should pass.

I'll use the provided PDF file from the issue, assuming it's placed in the correct directory. The test will import getDocument and use it to load the PDF. If it successfully gets the first page, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external setup beyond what's already imported. I'll also ensure that the test accurately reflects the expected behavior changes due to the patch.

```javascript
it("should correctly parse and render PDFs with non-standard trailer structures", async () => {
  const { getDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const pdfPath = `${TEST_PDFS_PATH}/issue16759.pdf`;
  
  try {
    const pdfDoc = await getDocument({
      url: pdfPath,
      factory: new DefaultFileReaderFactory(new FetchStream()),
      onPassword: () => PasswordResponses.CANCEL
    });
    const firstPage = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);
    assert(firstPage, "PDF page could not be loaded");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("PDF is still invalid after patch");
    }
    throw error;
  }
});
```

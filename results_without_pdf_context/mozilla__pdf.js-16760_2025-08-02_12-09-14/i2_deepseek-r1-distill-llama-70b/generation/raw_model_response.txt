Okay, so I need to write a regression test for the issue where a PDF that used to render in older Firefox versions now doesn't. The problem was caused by a change in how the XRef class parses the PDF, specifically with the gEndobjRegExp. The patch adjusted this regex to avoid matching "trailer" incorrectly. 

First, I should understand what the patch does. The original regex was /\b(endobj|\d+\s+\d+\s+obj|xref|trailer)\b/g. The patch changed it to include "trailer" followed by optional whitespace and <<, so it doesn't mistakenly match "trailer" in the content stream. 

The test needs to verify that after the patch, the PDF renders correctly, whereas before it threw an error. I'll need to create a test that loads the problematic PDF and checks if it's parsed without errors.

I'll structure the test using Jest. I'll import the necessary modules like PDFDocument and InvalidPDFException. Then, I'll define the test case using it(). The test will try to load the provided PDF file.

I'll use a try-catch block. If the PDFDocument constructor throws an InvalidPDFException, the test should fail. If it doesn't, it means the PDF was loaded correctly, so the test passes.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and uses the correct import paths. I'll dynamically import the required modules from the specified paths. 

So, the test will look like this: attempt to load the PDF, and if it doesn't throw the exception, the test passes. This ensures that the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly parse PDFs with 'trailer' in content streams", async () => {
  const { PDFDocument } = await import("../../src/display/api.js");
  const { InvalidPDFException } = await import("../../shared/util.js");
  const pdfUrl = "https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/files/12185373/issue16759.pdf";

  try {
    const pdf = await PDFDocument.load(pdfUrl);
    await pdf.getPage(1);
    expect().nothing();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof InvalidPDFException) {
      throw new Error("PDF failed to load due to InvalidPDFException");
    }
    throw error;
  }
});
```

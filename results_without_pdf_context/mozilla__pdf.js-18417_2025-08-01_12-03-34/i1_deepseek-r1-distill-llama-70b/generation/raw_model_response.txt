Alright, I need to write a regression test for the issue where adding a `<base href>` tag breaks transparency filters in Firefox. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll look at the provided patch. It modifies `display_utils.js` to correctly handle URLs when a `<base>` tag is present. The key change is in the `createUrl` method, which now constructs the URL correctly by considering the base URL.

I'll start by examining the existing test file. It imports several functions from `display_utils.js`, but none related to the filter factory. So, I'll need to import `DOMFilterFactory` and any necessary dependencies.

The test should simulate the presence of a `<base>` tag. In a real scenario, this might involve setting `document.baseURI` or using a `<base>` element. Since this is a unit test, I can set `document.baseURI` to a specific value, like "http://example.com/", to mimic the presence of a `<base>` tag.

Next, I'll create an instance of `DOMFilterFactory` with a document that has the modified base URI. I'll then define some test filters, perhaps a simple identity filter for red, green, and blue channels.

After defining the filters, I'll apply them using `addFilter` and check the generated URLs. The URLs should correctly include the base URL followed by the fragment identifier. For example, if the base is "http://example.com/", the URL should be "http://example.com/#g_1_transfer_map_1".

I'll then compare the actual URLs against the expected ones to ensure they match. If they do, the test passes, indicating the patch works as intended.

I should structure the test as an `it` block within the existing test file. I'll use async/await for any necessary imports and ensure all variables are properly initialized. Since this is a unit test, I won't need to set up any DOM elements beyond what's already provided by the test environment.

Finally, I'll write the test code, making sure it's self-contained and only uses the provided imports. The test should clearly fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the issue is resolved.

```javascript
it("should handle base href correctly in filter URLs", async () => {
  const { DOMFilterFactory } = await import("../../src/display/display_utils.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");
  
  // Simulate the presence of a base href
  const originalBaseURI = document.baseURI;
  document.baseURI = "http://example.com/";
  
  const factory = new DOMFilterFactory();
  const filter = {
    transferMap: {
      red: [0, 1],
      green: [0, 1],
      blue: [0, 1],
    },
  };
  
  const url = await factory.addFilter(filter);
  
  // The URL should include the base href followed by the fragment
  const expectedUrl = "url(http://example.com/#g_1_transfer_map_1)";
  assert.strictEqual(url, expectedUrl);
  
  // Restore original baseURI
  document.baseURI = originalBaseURI;
});
```

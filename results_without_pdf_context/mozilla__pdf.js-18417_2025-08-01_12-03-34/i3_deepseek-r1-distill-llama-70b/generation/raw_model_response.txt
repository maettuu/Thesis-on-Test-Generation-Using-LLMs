Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where adding a `<base href>` tag breaks transparency filters in Firefox. The problem was fixed in the patch provided, so the test should fail before the patch and pass after.

First, I'll look at the existing test file. It imports some functions from display_utils.js, but I might need more. The test should check the filter URLs generated by DOMFilterFactory.

I remember the issue was related to how URLs are created for filters. The patch introduced the `createUrl` method, which uses the base URL correctly. So, the test should verify that the URLs are constructed properly when a `<base>` tag is present.

I'll set up a test scenario where the document has a `<base href=".">` tag. Then, I'll create a DOMFilterFactory instance and check the URLs it generates. If the URL starts with the correct base, the test passes.

I'll use Jest to write the test. I'll mock the document to include the base href. Then, I'll create the filter factory, generate a filter, and check the URL.

I'll structure the test with Jest's `it` function, using async/await for any promises. I'll import necessary modules and set up the mock document and base href.

Finally, I'll write assertions to check if the generated URLs include the base href correctly. This ensures that the patch fixes the issue.

```javascript
it("should correctly create filter URLs with base href", async () => {
  const { DOMFilterFactory } = await import("../../src/display/display_utils.js");
  const { document } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  // Mock document with base href
  const mockDocument = {
    ...document,
    baseURI: "http://example.com/",
    createElementNS: jest.fn(),
    getElementsByTagName: jest.fn(() => [{ href: "." }]),
  };

  const factory = new DOMFilterFactory({ ownerDocument: mockDocument });
  const filter = await factory.addFilter([new Array(256).fill(0)]);

  expect(filter).toMatch(/^url\(http:\/\/example\.com\/#.+?\)$/);
});
```

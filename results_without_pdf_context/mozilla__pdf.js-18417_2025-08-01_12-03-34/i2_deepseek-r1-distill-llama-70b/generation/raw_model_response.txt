Okay, I need to write a regression test for the issue where adding a `<base href>` tag breaks transparency filters in Firefox. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The bug occurs when a `<base href>` is present, causing incorrect rendering of drop shadows in Firefox. The patch modifies `display_utils.js` to create absolute URLs for filters when necessary.

I should create a test that checks if the filter URLs are correctly generated as absolute when a `<base href>` is present. 

Looking at the patch, the `createUrl` method in `DOMFilterFactory` is added. It checks if the environment is development or GENERIC and then constructs the URL based on the presence of a `<base>` element. 

So, the test needs to simulate the presence of a `<base href>` and verify that the filter URLs are absolute. 

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Import the necessary modules, like `display_utils.js` and `util.js`.
2. Create a mock `document` object with a `<base>` element to simulate the issue.
3. Initialize `DOMFilterFactory` with this mock document.
4. Call a method that generates a filter URL, like `addFilter`.
5. Check if the generated URL is absolute.

I'll write the test using Jest syntax. I'll mock the `document` to have a `<base href=".">` tag. Then, I'll create an instance of `DOMFilterFactory` with this document. I'll call `addFilter` with some maps and check if the resulting URL starts with the base URL.

I need to ensure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external files. I'll use dynamic imports for compatibility with Node.js.

Finally, I'll structure the test so that it fails before the patch (expecting a relative URL) and passes after the patch (expecting an absolute URL).

```javascript
it("should create absolute filter URLs when <base> element is present", async () => {
  const { DOMFilterFactory } = await import("../../src/display/display_utils.js");
  const { Util } = await import("../../src/shared/util.js");

  // Mock document with <base> element
  const mockDocument = {
    baseURI: "http://example.com/",
    URL: "http://example.com/",
    baseURI: "http://example.com/",
    getElementsByTagName: () => [
      { href: "." }
    ]
  };

  const factory = new DOMFilterFactory({ ownerDocument: mockDocument });
  const filter = await factory.addFilter([0, 255]);

  expect(filter).toMatch(/^http:\/\/example\.com\/#/);
});
```

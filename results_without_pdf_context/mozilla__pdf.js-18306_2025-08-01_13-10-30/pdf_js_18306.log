[2025-08-01 13:20:28] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should correctly render PDF with noninteger DW", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");
  const { Dict, Name } = await import("../../src/core/primitives.js");
  const { WorkerTask } = await import("../../src/core/worker.js");
  const { OperatorList } = await import("../../src/core/operator_list.js");

  const xref = new XRefMock([]);
  const handler = null;
  const pageIndex = 0;
  const idFactory = createIdFactory(pageIndex);
  const fontCache = new Map();
  const builtInCMapCache = new Map();
  const standardFontDataCache = new Map();
  const globalImageCache = new Map();
  const systemFontCache = new Map();
  const options = {};

  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler,
    pageIndex,
    idFactory,
    fontCache,
    builtInCMapCache,
    standardFontDataCache,
    globalImageCache,
    systemFontCache,
    options,
  });

  const dict = new Dict();
  dict.set("DW", 500.5);
  dict.set("W", [0, 100, 200, 300]);

  const properties = { composite: true };
  const operatorList = new OperatorList();
  const task = new WorkerTask("test");

  await evaluator.extractWidths(dict, null, properties);

  const expectedDefaultWidth = 501;
  const actualDefaultWidth = properties.defaultWidth;

  expect(actualDefaultWidth).toBe(expectedDefaultWidth);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/evaluator_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

[2025-08-01 13:30:14] SUCCESS  : Suggested test for PR:


Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and serves as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes in the new codebase after the PR, and
- fails in the old codebase before the PR.

```javascript
it("should use ceil for noninteger DW values", async () => {
  const { PartialEvaluator } = await import("../../src/core/evaluator.js");

  const xref = {
    fetchIfRef: (value) => value
  };

  const dict = {
    get: (key) => {
      if (key === "DW") return 500.5;
      if (key === "W") return [1, 2, 3];
      return null;
    },
    getArray: () => null
  };

  const properties = {
    composite: true,
    vertical: false,
    firstChar: 0
  };

  const evaluator = new PartialEvaluator({
    xref,
    handler: null,
    pageIndex: 0,
    idFactory: null,
    fontCache: null,
    builtInCMapCache: null,
    standardFontDataCache: null,
    globalImageCache: null,
    systemFontCache: null,
    options: null
  });

  evaluator.extractWidths(dict, {}, properties);

  expect(properties.defaultWidth).toBe(501);
});
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test in the `test/unit/evaluator_spec.js` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).
